 Contrary to popular belief, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were not the
 first to land on the Moon. It was Luna 2, a robotic space probe the 
size ofa large beach ball, which arrived there 10 years earlier. First 
to reach another planet, first to land on Mars and Venus, first to touch
 an asteroid, first to see the outer planets close up, first to land on 
the moon of another planet; the list ofrobotic space achievements is 
long and impressive. In fact, robots ventured into space even before 
robot assemblers took over the car factories and robot vacuum cleaners 
and robodogs were let loose in our houses. Until the 1950s, before the 
start of the Space Age, space exploration was envisioned to become the 
domain of bold heroes in spacesuits, shooting through the void in 
elegant rocketships. Buck Rogers and his colleagues were the public's 
stereotypes of space explorers, and even more scientific books and 
artworks focused on manned capsules, spaceplanes, space stations, and 
planetary bases. No one seemed to foresee that the exploration of space 
would actually become the domain of unmanned machines. At a fraction of 
the costs of manned spacecraft, automatic probes became the true 
explorers of the Solar System. Xl<br>
<br>
 Preface Although the manned space programs get most of the media 
attention, robotic space probes are still going further and faster than 
any astronaut ever has. These machines do not need oxygen, food or 
sleep, can spend decades in high vacuum, and can endure extreme 
temperatures without complaining. Unlike people, they can be made small 
and are adaptable to nearly any hostile environment. When uncrewed 
probes are lost, the tragedy is much less grave than it would have been 
had astronauts been on board. Space robots can be replaced, but people 
cannot. Moreover, space probes do not have to come back after completion
 of their mission. Our hardy robots have gone inside the turbulent 
atmosphere of the giant gas planet Jupiter, moved out beyond the orbit 
of Pluto and landed on asteroids while we humans are still fiddling 
around in low Earth orbit . True, we have set foot on the Moon, but the 
last time we did that was well over 30 years ago. However, even while 
you are reading this, brave machines are trailblazing the Solar System 
in preparation for future human exploration. This book tries to give 
these courageous satellites and probes the glory they deserve. A way to 
understand unmanned spacecraft is to compare them with living beings. 
Like animals and people, spacecraft need energy, interact with their 
environment, and have different body parts (called "subsystems") that 
perform necessary functions. Similar to many organisms, space probes 
need to keep themselves within a certain temperature range, have a 
skeletal structure, a brain to process sensory inputs and regulate 
internal functions, and equipment to see, smell, hear, feel, and 
communicate. In fact, we regularly react to less complicated machines 
such as cars and computers as if they were alive, especially when they 
do not work properly (the number of people who physically assault their 
computer monitor is quite high . . .). In this book, comparisons between
 spacecraft, everyday machines, and animals are used to explain 
complicated technical issues. You will see that you do not need to be a 
rocket scientist to understand the basic workings of a spacecraft. In 
the Introduction we look at the history of robotic space exploration, 
and how astronauts and robots are complementary in pushing the frontiers
 of human knowledge. We will see how a robotic space mission is started 
with new ideas, scientific questions and a lot of engineering, and are 
then going to dissect a space probe to see how it works. We will move on
 to find out how spacecraft are tested and qualified for a trip into 
interplanetary space. The topic of the following chapter is scientific 
instruments - the many eyes through which a robotic space explorer 
investigates new worlds. xu<br>
<br>
 Preface As you read on, you will discover how these ingenious automatic
 probes are launched, and then how they have pushed the boundaries of 
our imagination and scientific understanding. The knowledge they provide
 lives on, even after the last spark of energy has been squeezed out of 
their batteries. They are truly paving the way for us. I want to thank 
my girlfriend Stefania for all her support and suggestions. Alessandro 
Atzei, Peter Buist, Dennis Gerrits, Zeina Mounzer and Ron Noteborn, once
 again loads of gratitude for checking the engineering details and 
spelling, as well as offering important facts and fictions that 
certainly enriched this book. They made sure my descriptions remained 
precise and kept me from becoming too much of a fuzzy dreamer. I also 
thank Arno Wielders for helping to make the chapter on payload 
instruments quite a bit more understandable and complete, and Stella 
Tkatchova has my gratitude for reading the text from a nonengineering 
perspective - something nearly impossible to do for the techno-biased 
rest ofus. As before, lowe a lot to Clive Horwood ofPraxis and to Paul 
Farrell and my good friend Harry Blom of Copernicus for their confidence
 and support. John Mason of Praxis thoroughly scrutinized the first 
draft of this book and significantly improved both the style and the 
contents; any mistakes that remain are solely my responsibility. 
Finally, I wish to thank Praxis copy editor Alex Whyte for converting my
 "Eurenglish" into American.<br>

N our modern high-tech world we very much depend on the unique benefits 
of space, although we often do not realize it. Satellites broadcast a 
television news program to us, including a report from Moscow sent to 
the news studio by a journalist via a satellite link. The report 
concerns the latest international agreements to limit the production of 
CFC-chemicals, which, when they escape into the atmosphere, can destroy 
the ozone layer. Earth-observing satellites helped to reveal the extent 
of the problem over Antarctica, and detected the smaller ozone holes 
over the Arctic. This new knowledge convinced us that we must prevent 
further damage to this precious atmospheric shield, which protects us 
against the harmful ultraviolet radiation of the Sun. Without continuous
 monitoring from space, it would have been impossible for scientists and
 politicians to appreciate the scale of the ozone problem. Without 
urgent action, the ozone holes could have grown much larger, 
considerably increasing our chances of developing skin cancer or 
cataracts. Another news item is about the International Space Station, 
where astronauts are investigating the effects on the human body in 
microgravity conditions. This will help us to plan and design future 
crewed expeditions to the Moon and Mars. The astronauts were recently 1<br>

 Chapter 1 joined by a so-called Flight Participant - a rich person who 
bought a ticket on board a Russian Soyuz spacecraft to visit the space 
station. Thanks to space technology, it is now possible for 
non-professional astronauts to experience the thrill of a launch, 
weightlessness, and the magnificent view of the Earth from orbit. It is 
still very expensive, but ticket prices may come down in the future and 
allow more and more people to take their holiday of a lifetime. The 
weather forecast following the news is based on pictures made from orbit
 by meteorological satellites. We pick up the phone and within seconds, 
using satellite telephone links, we talk to friends and family on the 
other side of the planer. We learn that an adventurous relative narrowly
 escaped drowning when his yacht sank in a storm in the Pacific Ocean. 
He was rescued by a Navy ship that received a distressand location 
signal from a transmitter on his life raft. The signal had been 
forwarded to them by a Search and Rescue radio system on board a 
satellite. We browse the Internet and, via an orbital connection, check 
how the stock exchange is doing in Tokyo . Next, we go to visit a 
colleague who wants to show his new house, which has advanced solar 
arrays on the roof that are based on solar cells developed for 
spacecraft. The navigation system in our car accurately guides us to his
 place using GPS signals from positioning system satellites. Meanwhile, 
we are curious about the endless Universe around us and send space 
probes to the planets and beyond. We are discovering the magnificence 
and the unbelievable diversities of the new worlds we explore, and at 
the same time start to understand how unique our own Earth really is. 
The exploration of the Solar System is a marvelous, inspiring adventure,
 and the science, the technology and the challenges involved make it an 
endeavor like no other. The quest for scientific knowledge is a worthy 
goal in its own right, but the exploration of the Solar System has 
direct uses as well. For instance, what the investigation of the planets
 tell us about the runaway greenhouse effect on Venus and the thin, 
ozone-less atmosphere of Mars helps us to make better predictions about 
what is happening to our own atmosphere here on Earth. We are used to 
all these space applications, which have been seamlessly integrated into
 our daily lives to such an extent that we hardly think about them any 
more . However, until 50 years ago this was all pure science fiction; 
there were simply no satellites and no interplanetary probes flying 
through the Solar System.<br>

 Introduction<br>
<br>
FROM THE GROUND UP The sky at night has fascinated us for as long as we 
can look back. Early man thought that the Earth was the center of 
everything, and that the stars were mere points of light hanging 
overhead. Most stars appeared to be fixed forever in the same patterns 
or constellations, and by drawing lines between stars appearing close 
together we could picture animals and gods in them. A few stars, 
however, moved differently around the sky, and the ancient Greek called 
these objects "planets," meaning "wandering stars." At first we thought 
the Sun, Moon and planets all revolved around us, until Copernicus 
revived a long forgotten idea of the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of 
Samos that the Sun was actually the queen of the Solar System and that 
the planets, including Earth , were orbiting her. The movements in the 
sky made much more sense this way. Planets nevertheless remained 
mysterious specs of light until the telescope was invented . Galileo 
Galilei used the new instrument to discover that the Moon was scarred by
 thousands oflarge craters, and that the planet Jupiter had four large 
moons of its own. As telescope technology advanced, the amazing rings of
 Saturn were observed, and the outer planets Uranus, Neptune and 
Trans-Neptunian objects such as Pluto were discovered. (It now appears 
that there are many more small Pluto-type planets beyond Neptune.) We 
discovered that the Sun is only one of 200 billion stars in a diskshaped
 system we see edge-on as the Milky Way, and that there are an 
uncountable number of other galaxies. The planets proved to be more than
 points oflight; Venus was found to have a thick atmosphere, Mars had 
polar caps, and Jupiter was surrounded by ever-changing bands of clouds.
 Telescopes grew larger and larger, but we always had to remain on Earth
 and could never actually visit the planets to inspect them close-up. 
Because of this limitation, misconceptions arose that could not be 
proven false, such as the idea that the craters on the Moon had a 
volcanic origin (while they are in fact created by the impacts of 
comets, asteroids and meteorites), or that Mars was covered with long, 
possibly artificial, channels or canals and intriguing changing patterns
 of vegetation (the canals later proved to be an optical illusion of 
vague features together appearing as lines, and the changing spots of 
vegetation were shown to be dark rock plateaus that are sometimes partly
 covered by lighter colored dust). However, in the mid-twentieth century
 the state of technology offered us a way to visit these mysterious 
places - in person or using remotely operated automatic probes. 3<br>

ROCKETS AND SATELLITES The history of satellites and space probes is 
directly linked to the history of the rocket, as this was the only 
machine that could achieve the extreme velocities and altitudes required
 to put objects into space. The first to really understand that we would
 need to develop large rockets before we could even think of developing 
artificial satellites was a Russian schoolteacher by the name of 
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (18571935). Born deaf, he was unable to attend 
normal elementary schools, but he taught himself physics and mathematics
 from books. His father sent him to Moscow to study further, but limited
 by his deafness he spent most ofhis time in the great Moscow libraries.
 Nevertheless,just as he had done before, he educated himself using the 
library books he found, and in 1882 he managed to get a job as a 
mathematics teacher in the town ofKaloega, south of Moscow. Ever since 
Tsiolkovsky was 12 years old, he had been fascinated by rockets and 
their possibilities for the exploration of space. He understood that 
only rockets can still work in the vacuum that exists above the Earth's 
atmosphere; unlike , for instance, propeller engines, they do not need 
air because rockets produce their own gasses to propel themselves . 
Furthermore, unlike car engines and jet engines, rockets do not depend 
on atmospheric oxygen to sustain combustion since they carry their own 
oxidizers. As the fuel and oxidizer (oxygen) mix in the combustion 
chamber and ignite, they form a fast expanding gas that is expelled at 
great velocity through the rocket nozzle. Following the "Action = 
Reaction" principle of Newton, the rocket itself will be thrust forward 
(the reaction) in the opposite direction to that in which the exhaust 
gases are going (the action). It is like standing on a skateboard and 
throwing rocks in the backward direction, which makes you move forward. 
In his free time, Tsiolkovsky increasingly busied himself with the 
theories of spaceflight. He wrote about steerable airships, manned 
rockets, self-sustaining space stations and spacesuits. Since even 
motorized airplanes were still science fiction at the time, his fellow 
citizens considered him to be rather eccentric. However, Tsiolkovsky was
 far from mad. He understood the physics ofrocketry and formulated the 
basic mathematical equations describing the workings of a rocket and the
 dynamics of its flight. In 1903, the same year that the Wright 
brothers' first motorized plane took off, he invented a method of 
"staging": stacking series of rockets on top of each other. This method 
increases the efficiency of launchers, as 4<br>

<br>
stages can be dropped off when their tanks run dry, ensuring that their 
useless empty mass does not have to be dragged all the way into orbit. 
Under the Russian Tsar's regime Tsiolkovsky never enjoyed any government
 support, but this changed dramatically after the 1917 Revolution and 
the Soviets came to power. In 1919 he was even made a Member of the 
prestigious Academy of Sciences and between 1925 and 1932 no less than 
60 of his papers were published. Tsiolkovsky died in 1935, and although 
he never built any rockets himself, he inspired a number of young 
Russian rocket experimenters who, in the 1930s, began to build small 
experimental rockets based on liquid propellants. As a testimony to his 
vision, Tsiolkovsky's most famous words can be found on his gravestone: 
"The Earth is the cradle of mankind, but one cannot stay in the cradle 
forever." Also in other countries scientists and engineers started to 
think about the possibilitiesfor rockets to reach outer space. In 1918 
American Robert Goddard had already built and launched an extensive 
series of small rockets, ofwhich the largest measured 1.70 meters (5.1 
feet) in length and weighed 20 kilograms (44 pounds). They were supposed
 to lead to rocket weapons that could be used in the First W orld War, 
but the fighting was over before Goddard's developments were finished 
and the military lost interest in his work. Nevertheless, Goddard 
continued his research and experimentation, 5<br>

rocket, which he launched in 1926. Unlike in modem rockets, the nozzle

and the following year he published a report called "A Method of 
Reaching Extreme Altitudes" in which he described how a rocket could 
reach the Moon and signal its arrival by use of flash powder igniting at
 impact. However, in spite of the scientificallysound basis of his 
proposals, Goddard's ideas were met with disbelief and ridicule. 
Persevering, in 1926 he flew the first ever liquid-fueled rocket. Like 
Tsiolkovsky, he realized that rocket systems based on liquid propellant 
have a number of advantage s over the simpler solid propellant 6<br>
<br>
 Introduction (gunpowder) rockets used then for artillery and fireworks.
 Liquid propellant rockets have a lower mass relative to their thrust 
and, unlike solid propellant rockets, can be throttled up or down, or 
stopped entirely. In 1935 Goddard's rockets had broken the sound barrier
 and reached a height of 1.5 kilometers (0.9 mile), but the US 
government did not seem to appreciate the possibilities of this 
technology. During the Second World War all they did was assign Goddard a
 contract for the development of a starting rocket to help carrier-based
 aircraft to take off from their ships. In the meantime Germany had 
seriously started to develop rockets. In 1923 Hermann Oberth published 
his classic book Die Rakete zu den Planetenrdumen ("The Rocket into 
Planetary Space"), stimulating young German engineers to experiment with
 rockets themselves. Oberth's own interest in rockets had been 
stimulated when, at the age of 12, his mother had given him a copy 
ofJules Verne's From the Earth to the Moon. Oberth's inspiring book 
resulted in the launch of the first ever rocketpowered aircraft in 1928,
 while in the same year car manufacturer Fritz von Opel achieved 200 
kilometers (124 miles) per hour in a rocket car and reached 153 
kilometers (95 miles) per hour flying a glider fitted with solid 
propellant rockets. In 1931, Germany's first liquid propellant rocket 
left a proving ground near Berlin, while two years later Viennese 
Professor Eugene Sanger published a book called Raketenflugtechnik 
("Rocketflight technology") that contained a concept for a high-speed 
rocket-propelled research aircraft. Unlike in America, the developments 
in rocketry caught the serious attention of the military. German Army 
leaders saw the development of large, powerful rocket bombs as a way to 
circumvent the ban on the use of large cannons, as stipulated in the 
Treaty of Versailles, which Germany had been forced to sign after its 
defeat in the First World War . The futuristic engineers were recruited 
by the military, and instead of reaching for space they found themselves
 developing ballistic missiles. However, both parties needed the same 
rocket technology to achieve their goals, and while the engineers had 
the brains, the military could provide the much-needed financial and 
logistical support. Wernher von Braun, one of the group's younger 
spaceflight enthusiasts, greatly impressed the military leaders. 
Although he was only 20 years old, they appointed him to lead the 
technical part of their extensive rocket development. Soon the 
development team's expanding activities required a dedicated 
development, production and launch center, and it was decided to create 
such a center in Peenemtinde, a remote, sparsely inhabited place at the 7<br>
<br>
 Chapter 1 Baltic Sea in the north of Germany, far from spying Allied 
eyes. Laboratories, wind tunnels, test stands, launch platforms and 
housing facilities for the 2,000 rocket scientistsand 4,000 supporting 
workers, plus their families, were built there. Until the Second World 
War rockets had been small and incapable of carrying much or going very 
high, but with the support of the Nazi war machine von Braun's team 
developed a 14-meter-high (46-foot-high) monster capable of launching a 
738-kilogram (1,630-pound) warhead a distance of 418 kilometers (260 
miles). In 1942 they launched their first rocket into space, reaching a 
height of80 kilometers (50 miles), a distance of 193 kilometers (120 
miles), and attaining a velocity of over 5,300 kilometers (3,300 miles) 
per hour. The A4 rocket that the Peenemiinde group created was soon 
renamed "Vengeance 2" by the Nazi government . Before the war was over, 
thousands of V2 rocket bombs were launched at London and liberated 
Antwerp, blowing away entire blocks of houses in an instant. 
Fortunately, the V2 and the other "Wonder Weapons" of Nazi Germany were 
unable to tum the tide of the war, and in 1945 Germany<br>

 Introduction surrendered. Understanding that ballistic missiles were 
going to playa major role in military power, a race developed among the 
Soviet, British and American military forces to find as many German 
rocket engineers and blueprints, and as much hardware, as they could get
 their hands on. Located in what was soon to become East Germany, 
Peenemiinde was destined to be under Soviet control. However, von Braun 
and most of the leading figures of the Peenemiinde team had fled the 
rocket base, carrying as much documentation and hardware with them as 
they could . Convinced that their best chance for continuing rocket 
development lay with the United States, they surrendered to American 
forces. They also gave them directions to find crucial documentation 
that they had hidden in an underground mine. Some 14 tons of design 
blueprints, test reports and other archive materials were transported to
 the American sector just before the British took control of the region,
 as agreed. The material would have become British property had it 
remained in the mine. In another daring smuggling operation, the 
American Army managed to transport 341 rail carts of rocket equipment 
out of an underground factory in the Harz mountains, just before the 
area had to be turned over to the Soviets. The Americans now had the 
best cards for the future: the rockets, the documentation and most of 
the German experts. Nevertheless, the Russians also managed to retain a 
few rocket experts and some rocket parts, while the British obtained 
some hardware. (Some of the V2s they "liberated" can still be seen in 
the Imperial War Museum and the Science Museum in London.) America and 
Russia soon moved the German engineers to their own development centers 
and put them to work on new ballistic missile projects. With the Cold 
War just starting, the development of large rockets became a top 
priority in America and Russia. Once again, von Braun and his consorts 
found themselves working on military weapons instead of spacecraft. In 
Russia, chief designer Sergei Korolev was the driving force behind the 
Soviet rocket program. Originally a carpenter and slater turned aircraft
 designer, Korolev decided to pursue spaceflight after having met 
Tsiolkovsky. He started equipping gliders and other airplanes with 
rocket engines and even flew some of them himself In the 1930s Korolev 
grouped with a couple ofother rocket fanatics and started GIRD, a 
Russian abbreviation for "Group for Research of Reactive Propulsion ." 
Working without any financial support, they jokingly explained that 
their club's name meant "Group of Engineers Working without Money." 9<br>
<br>
 Chapter 1 Nevertheless, in 1933 they managed to launch the first Soviet
 liquid propellant rocket, designed by rocket pioneer Fridrikh Tsander, 
to an altitude of 400 meters (1,300 feet). Now the military became 
interested, offered financial support and even founded a special 
institute for the development of rocketry . However, the Soviet Union 
under Stalin was a dangerous place in which to live and work. Together 
with almost half the officer corps of the Red Army, the Field Marshal 
who supported Korolev and his colleagues was accused of conspiring with 
Nazi Germany and executed on Stalin's orders. Because of his link with 
the Marshal, even Korolev was arrested. According to the accusations, he
 was supposed to have tried to sabotage a rocketplane he was working on.
 Korolev narrowly escapedbeing shot, but was sentenced to 10 years of 
forced labor in the infamous Kolyma gold mines of Siberia. However, when
 the Second World War broke out Stalin realized that he desperately 
needed technicians and Korolev was brought back to Moscow. Still under 
custody, he was put to work on military planes and rockets. After the 
war, Korolev continued his work on rocketry together with the captured 
German engineers and scientists of von Braun's Peenemunde team. Taking 
advantage of the German experts' knowledge, Korolev and his group were 
soon building Russian copies of the V2 rocket. Unlike their colleagues 
in America, the German experts in Russia were dismissed and sent home 
after their V2 work was completed. Korolev' s institute, now fully 
supported by Stalin, continued its work and started to launch rockets 
that were increasingly larger and more advanced. Soon they were capable 
of launching satellites in Earth orbit. To put a satellite into orbit, 
you need to give it a very high velocity. Imagine a tower with a cannon 
on top of it, aimed horizontally to the horizon. The fired shell will be
 given a velocity in the horizontal direction , but as soon as it leaves
 the cannon's muzzle, gravity will start pulling it down. As a result 
the shell's trajectory is curved downward, and it hits the ground a 
certain distance from the cannon. If you manage to put more gunpowder 
into your cannon and fire it again, the second shell will get a higher 
initial velocity, and therefore fly further before it impacts. Now 
imagine a truly huge gun, able to give a projectile the enormous 
velocity of7.5 kilometers (4.7 miles) per second. Again, as soon as the 
shell is fired, gravity starts pulling it down into a curved trajectory.
 However, the shell now manages to fly very, very far in the horizontal 
direction before it falls to ground level. In fact, at this velocity it 
flies over the horizon and, as it falls down, the ground level also 
moves down because of the Earth's curvature. 10<br>

FIGURE 1.4 Thefaster a cannonball, thefurther it willjly.lfshot at a 
high enough velocity and at sufficient altitude, the projectile could go
 into orbit.<br>
<br>
At 7.8 kilometers (4.8 miles) per second the curvature ofthe 
projectile's trajectory is exactly the same as the curvature of the 
Earth . The shell thus never reaches the ground, but falls all the way 
around the Earth to hit the cannon in the back. If you could quickly 
remove the cannon, the shell would continue to fall around the planet in
 a circle. It would then be in Earth orbit and have become a satellite. 
In reality this does not work, owing to the atmospheric drag that 
continuously slows down the projectile. To keep the projectile in orbit 
you would need to put it above the atmosphere, at least to an altitude 
of about 200 kilometers (130 miles). Satellites are not launched by 
cannons, mostly because the enormous acceleration needed to bring them 
from 0 to 7.8 kilometers (4.8 miles) per second over the length of the 
cannon's barrel would be far too high for most on board equipment to 
survive. Instead, rocket launchers are used to relatively slowly 
increase the velocity and bring the satellite above the atmosphere. This
 requires an enormous amount of propellant and supporting equipment. 
Typically, it takes 100 kilograms (230 pounds) of propellant and 
launcher hardware to 11<br>
<br>
 Chapter 1 place 1 kilogram of satellite in a low Earth orbit. Hence a 
satellite launcher needs to be very, very large. In the 1950s Soviet 
nuclear technology was behind that of America, making Russia's nuclear 
bombs much heavier than those of its rival. The Soviets had to put much 
effort and money into building rockets that were large enough to be able
 to launch their weapons at the United States. The USA, with its more 
sophisticated and lighter nuclear bombs, only needed relatively small 
launchers. However, in spaceflight large launchers mean that you can put
 heavier satellites into orbit, and so the Russian military disadvantage
 soon turned into an unforeseen spaceflight advantage. On October 
4,1957, a 58-centimeter (23-inch) polished metal sphere called "Sputnik"
 was put into orbit on top of one ofKorolev's converted ballistic 
missiles. The instrumentation ofthis very basic satellite included a 
radio transmitter and devices for measuring the air density, temperature
 and electron concentrations in the uppermost part of the atmosphere . 
Using its four long antennas it continuously transmitted its coded 
"beep, beep" signal until its battery was empty 21 days later. Sputnik 1
 remained in orbit for a total of 96 days, until the minute drag of the 
upper atmosphere slowed it down sufficiently to be pulled back to Earth.
 It burned up in the atmosphere after making 1,400 orbits around our 
planet. The attention of the world for the Soviet success was 
overwhelming, enforced by the fact that on a clear night people could 
actually see Sputnik as a star-like point of light moving across the 
sky. Thanks to sunlight, it reflected back to the night side ofthe Earth
 (in fact, what people saw at the time was not the actual Sputnik 
satellite, but rather the much larger upper stage of the rocket orbiting
 close by). Thinking that Russia was a backward country years behind in 
technology, America had been taken completely by surprise. Totally 
underestimating Soviet rocket power, some people even thought the comma 
in the published "83,6 kg" (184 pounds) mass of Sputnik 1 was wrongly 
placed and that the satellite actually weighed only 8.36 kilograms (18.4
 pounds)! However, the Soviets proved that they could launch even larger
 objects when only a month later they put Sputnik 2 into orbit. This 
satellite, weighing an incredible 508 kilograms (1,120 pounds), even 
carried a dog named Laika on board! Housed in a small, pressured 
container, Laika served as a test subject for obtaining data on the 
effects of microgravity on mammals. As the satellite did not contain a 
return capsule, the unfortunate animal died seven days later when the 
oxygen supply ran out. Nevertheless, Laika's flight showed the Soviet's 
intention to launch people into space; it 12<br>
<br>
 Introduction also showed that this would in principle be possible once a
 way was found to bring them back to Earth . Nightmares of Soviet 
nuclear missile platforms in space and on the Moon made the USA scramble
 to get its own satellites into orbit. The problem was that the USA had 
only developed relatively small ballistic missiles for their relatively 
light nuclear bombs, and these were barely powerful enough to launch 
anything into orbit. On December 6, 1957 the United States Navy's 
fragile Vanguard rocket with its puny Vanguard satellite (Russia's 
leader Khrushchev called it a "grapefruit") toppled over and exploded on
 its Cape Canaveral launch pad in front of the television cameras. 
America's pride was hurt deeply. Fortunately, von Braun's team had not 
lost its vision of launching satellites while working on rockets for the
 US Army. Unofficially and secretly, the German experts had converted a 
ballistic missile into a satellite launcher. The USA could have had 
their satellite in orbit before Sputnik, but politics had assigned the 
space program to the Navy. Now, with the whole nation in a hurry to 
catch up with the Soviets, von Braun and his Army team were given the 
go-ahead to launch the Explorer 1 satellite with their Juno 1 rocket. 
The launch on January 30, 1958, was a complete success and gave America 
back some of its confidence in its own technological capabilities. 
Instrumentation on board Explorer 1 even discovered large bands of 
charged particles from the Sun trapped by the Earth's magnetic field. 
These were later named the Van Allen radiation belts, after the American
 physicist James Van Allen who had designed the particle measurement 
equipment. The next big step was to send a person into orbit . With the 
launch of Yuri Gagarin in 1961 the Soviets were first again, but the 
Russian cosmonauts were soon followed by NASA astronauts. As launchers 
got bigger and satellite equipment technology advanced, Russia and 
America sent increasingly larger and heavier satellites into orbit . At 
first their purpose was only to measure the conditions in space, but 
soon they were also put to practical use such as relaying telephone and 
television signals and observing the Earth. This has in fact now become 
the commercially most important application of space. The Soviet and US 
governments also soon recognized the military value of satellites, in 
particular for observing each other's military installations with large 
telescope cameras and for intercepting radio signals. As each side put 
ever larger numbers of nuclear missiles into operation and tightened 
security around them , satellites were the best, and often the only, way
 to monitor enemy rocket launches and atomic bomb 13<br>

satellites are still being launched today, even though the Cold War is 
over. Many nations still want, and need, to know what their neighbors 
.are building in their back yard. Astronomy became another important 
occupation for satellites. High above the Earth's atmosphere - which 
filters out much of the spectrum of scientifically interesting radiation
 and disturbs light so that stars appear to twinkle - orbital 
observatories have an unprecedented clear view on the Universe. Both the
 USA and the Soviet Union started to launch ever more sophisticated 
space observatories, detecting objects in the Universe that were 
completely unknown until then. The study of exotic objects such as black
 holes and gamma-ray bursts started entirely new branches of the ancient
 science of astronomy. The pictures of the famous Hubble Space Telescope
 now frequently reach the front pages of the newspapers, but equally 
interesting data is sent to us by modern X-ray, gamma-ray and infrared 
observing satellites such as the XMM and Integral ofESA (European Space 
Agency), and NASA's Chandra Observatory and Spitzer Telescope. They have
 shown us a Universe that is even weirder than we ever imagined, with 
all kinds of peculiar star systems, mysterious black holes, gaseous 
nebulae where new 14<br>
<br>
 Introduction stars are born, and old stars dying in gigantic 
explosions. However, even though they look at objects millions of 
light-years away, these satellites still remain relatively close to 
Earth.<br>
<br>
TO THE MOON From the point of velocity and energy, once you have the 
ability to reach Earth orbit you don't have to stretch too much to send a
 space probe further - to the Moon or to the other planets in the Solar 
System. To stay in a low Earth orbit at an altitude of200 kilometers 
(125 miles), a satellite needs to have a velocity of about 7.8 
kilometers (4.8 miles) per second. To reach a much higher orbit at 
36,000 kilometers (23,000 miles) requires a boost of only an extra few 
kilometers per second. This velocity increase is not too hard to 
achieve, as the difficult part offlying up through the atmosphere with 
all its problems ofaerodynamic drag is already behind when you reach low
 Earth orbit. Moreover, as you get further from the Earth, the pull of 
its gravity weakens. The 36,000-kilometer (23,000-mile) altitude orbit 
over the equator is a very popular one for television and communication 
satellites, because there they circle the Earth in 23 hours 56 minutes. 
(The circle around the Earth they have to cover is much larger than for a
 low Earth orbit satellite and, furthermore, their orbital velocity is 
lower; the net effect is that while it takes a low orbit satellite only 
1.5 hours to go around once, it takes nearly 24 hours at 36,000 
kilometers .) As the Earth also makes one complete rotation in 23 hours 6
 minutes, it appears that the satellites are permanently hanging still 
over the same area, thereby acting as giant, stable antenna masts able 
to cover about a third of the planet per satellite. This 
36,000-kilometer (23,000-mile) circular orbit over the equator is 
therefore called the "Geostationary Earth Orbit," or "GEO." To 
completely escape Earth's gravity and go elsewhere in the Solar System, 
you'll need to achieve a velocity of 11.2 kilometers (7 miles) per 
second), starting from the Earth's surface. After achieving that, there 
is no need to keep the engine running as you would need to do with a 
vehicle on Earth; in space, once you achieve the right orbit, you cruise
 effortlessly along through the vacuum, unhindered by any braking 
friction. You are then in orbit around the Sun , only possibly disturbed
 by the gravity of other planets. That is why as early asJanuary 2, 
1959, only one year and three months after the launch of Sputnik 1, 
Russia already managed to send a probe to 15<br>
<br>
 Chapter 1 the Moon. Luna 1 was meant to hit our rocky neighbor, but 
just missed it and went into orbit around the Sun instead. On September 
15, its successor, Luna 2, hit its target spot-on. Crashing into an area
 called the "Sea of Rain," the metal ball showered the lunar surface 
with small emblems of the Soviet Union. Only a month later Luna 3 zoomed
 behind the Moon, taking the first ever pictures of the part of the 
lunar surface that is always turned away from us. As the electro-optical
 systems we have nowadays did not exist at the time, Luna 3 carried a 
conventional camera with rolls of film. Following exposure, the film had
 to be developed on board, then scanned by a kind of television camera 
system. The gray-scales of the scanned picture were coded into radio 
signals and sent to Earth, where they could be translated back into an 
image. Luna 3 showed that there were fewer "lunar seas" (the dark, 
relatively smooth areas on the Moon we can see with the naked eye) on 
the farside than on the nearside. As a bonus propaganda caper for the 
Soviet Union, Luna 3 also broadcast the Socialist International hymn 
from space. As with Sputnik 1, America was beaten once more . An even 
worse propaganda disaster for the USA occurred on April 12, 1961, when 
Russia managed to launch the first human into orbit . Cosmonaut Yuri 
Gagarin made one circle around the Earth in 108 minutes and landed 
safely on the deserted steppe of Kazakhstan. At that time , NASA was 
still only planning its first sub-orbital, parabolic "hops" with its 
Mercury capsule and low-power Redstone rocket combination. On May 5, 
astronaut Alan Shepard became the first American in space, although not 
in orbit, using this system. It took almost a year for America to catch 
up and equal Gagarin's flight; on February 20, 1962, John Glenn rode his
 Mercury capsule into orbit on top of a more powerful Atlas rocket, and 
completed three orbits. However, by that time Russian cosmonaut Gherrnan
 Titov had already circled the planet no less than 17 times during a 
flight lasting 25 hours 18 minutes. Tired of seeing the USA being second
 in all major space achievements until then, President Kennedy, in his 
famous speech of May 25, 1961, proclaimed that America should aim at 
landing a man on the Moon before the end of the decade. Apart from major
 advances in manned spaceflight, the ensuing "Moon Race " resulted in 
whole armadas of unmanned lunar orbiters and landers. The American 
Ranger spacecraft were first sent on kamikaze missions, aiming straight 
at points on the lunar surface while taking as many pictures as possible
 before impacting. Next came the soft-landing Surveyors, meant 16<br>
<br>
 Introduction to determine what the surface of the Moon looked like. 
Some scientists argued that billions of years of meteorite impacts and 
unfiltered radiation had pulverized the lunar surface to a depth of 
possibly many meters; astronauts attempting to land would surely sink 
into thick layers of dust. Fortunately they were wrong. Digging with 
their small scoops and making smalljumps on their landing gear to be 
able to observe the depth of their footprints , the Surveyors showed 
that the dust was only a few centimeters deep at most. In the meantime, 
NASA's Lunar Orbiters accurately photographed the surface from lunar 
orbit to find the most suitable landing spots for the upcoming manned 
Apollo missions. The Soviets had already confirmed their unmanned 
exploration prowess by being the first to softly land a probe on the 
surface with Luna 9, which made panoramic images of its surroundings. 
Their next spacecraft, Luna 10, became the first satellite of the Moon. 
Nevertheless, the Soviet Union was falling behind in the crewed part of 
the space race, as unmanned prototypes of its giant N-1 moonrocket 
consistently blew up shortly after leaving the launch pad. Without a 
proper heavy launcher, their large lunar capsules and landers were 
grounded. The giant Saturn V rocket developed by von Braun and his team 
was much more successful. After only two test flights, the second 
ofwhich was only partly successful, the machine was deemed to be ready 
for operational duty. NASA wanted to use the Saturn V as soon as 
possible to launch a crewed flight around the Moon before the Russians. 
The gamble paid off: in 1968 the enormous rocket engines pushed the 
first Americans in an orbit around the Moon on Apollo 8. The following 
year the crew of Apollo 11 thundered off the launch pad. Even as Neil 
Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin and Michael Collins were heading to the Moon to 
deliver on Kennedy's promise, Russia desperately sent the uncrewed Luna 
15 to land. Its mission was to quickly scoop up some grams of surface 
samples and return them to Earth before the American astronauts arrived 
with their load of moonrocks. However, while Apollo 11's crew prepared 
to leave the Moon and head back home, Luna 1S's mission ended with an 
inglorious crash on the lunar surface. The Soviets had failed to snatch 
some lunar dust before the American astronauts, leaving them unable to 
even slightly dim the blazing glory of Apollo 11.<br>

HUMANS VERSUS ROBOTS During the "Moon Race " of the 1960s, astronauts 
and cosmonauts captured the hearts of the public much more than any 
robotic spacecraft ever could, and proved to be far more flexible in 
adapting mission operations and handling emergency situations. Even in 
comparison with today's advanced robotic Marsrovers, the Apollo lunar 
astronauts were much more efficient in collecting surface samples and 
covered far more terrain in less time . The two NASA rovers that were 
landed on Mars in January 2004 have driven less than 10 kilometers (6 
miles) in two years ofoperation. The record distance for one rover in a 
Mars day (24 hours 37 minutes) was 220 meters (720 feet). Obviously a 
person in a spacesuit on Mars could do much better than that. An 
astronaut may need a minute to spot an interesting rock, walk to it, 
grab the stone and inspect it from all sides. For an unmanned rover the 
same process may take several days. Moreover, a human may see that the 
soil under the rock that has just been picked up has a strange color and
 decide to take a sample of it, while an automatic rover would not 
detect such a thing unless it was specifically instructed to look for 
it. A robotic probe can basicallyonly perform tasks it has been built to
 do before launch, while people are inventive and able to make creative 
use of what is at hand. An astronaut may decide to use a spade to break a
 small piece of a rock from the wall of a canyon a few meters high. 
Unless a rover has been equipped with a hammer and a long arm, it would 
not be capable ofdoing the same. For a robot, a rock is either an object
 to avoid or an object to push an instrument against. It is incapable of
 seeing the rock as a piece of a geological puzzle, or imaging flows 
ofwater shaping it into peculiar forms. Computers do not have 
imagination and creativity, and they are generally incapable oflearning 
by themselves; they literally cannot think "out of the box ." Because 
they need to be severely modified to survive in space, the computer 
technology flown in modem space probes is some 10 to 15 years behind 
what is used in a typical office or at home. With respect to a modem PC,
 space robots are rather backward. Moreover, even the most modem 
terrestrial supercomputer is ' barely able to approach the intelligence 
of a frog. They may be great in mathematics and even beat us in chess, 
but reasoning and making decisions in novel situations is not their 
strong point. However, the disadvantages of human spaceflight soon 
showed as well. 18<br>
<br>
 Introduction To begin with people require a certain rrurumum amount of 
living volume, food and oxygen that do not need to be included in 
robotic spacecraft. People want windows, want to sleep, want to interact
 with other human beings and have many more physical and psychological 
demands that are not an issue for robotic space exploration. People are 
also continuously "on," whether they are needed or not. During the long 
flights to their destination, robots can simply shut down or be put in 
hibernation mode. People need food and oxygen even if there is nothing 
for them to do and are really not needed for that part of the mission. 
Furthermore, people cannot be productive all the time. They need about a
 third of an Earth day to sleep, and also some time to wash, eat and 
relax. In principle, robots can work around the clock, day after day, 
week after week. They do not have holidays and they do not have unions. 
Human crewmembers can forget their training and make mistakes. They need
 to practice just to keep the skills they started with and perhaps 
improve on them. Robots never forget anything and they do not need to 
train (although there are now some experiments with "learning" robots 
that program themselves through experience) . Once rightly programmed, 
robot computer brains are able to refer to the right lines of software 
at any time. Improvements are possible by uploading updated software, 
with instant results . Robots are entirely reproducible; if one fails, 
you can send an exact copy to take over and you can even skip all the 
development that was necessary for the first model. In contrast, each 
person is unique and can never be truly replaced. People cannot simply 
"download" the training of their colleagues; for each new person you 
have to start all over again. Robots are expendable; people are not. 
Human crews also need to be brought back home after some time. This 
requires rockets and a lot of propellant, especially when they need to 
take off from another planet or moon; they require a heatshield for 
protection against the fierce heat caused by the collision with the 
atmosphere during re-entry, and parachutes for the final deceleration 
before landing. Space robots, generally, are simply left at their last 
destination. Another disadvantage is that people can die; we have to 
limit risks for human missions to levels far lower than what would be 
acceptable for a robotic mission. This involves the duplication of 
critical equipment, extra design evaluations and tests, and very large 
ground support teams for monitoring all the systems all the time . For 
human missions, "failure is not an option," while for unmanned missions 
risk is just another parameter that can be traded for lower costs and 
less complex designs. 19<br>
<br>
 Chapter 1 All this means that even the smallest crewed spacecraft is 
rather large, heavy, complex and thus expensive compared to an unmanned 
satellite with a similar amount of scientific equipment on board. To 
launch heavier and larger crewed spacecraft also requires larger and 
more expensive rockets. A typical Space Shuttle mission may cost as much
 as $500 million, just to send eight astronauts and some experiments in a
 low orbit around the Earth for less than two weeks. For about the same 
amount of money you can develop and launch a medium sized robotic 
orbiter, and investigate the surface ofanother planet for a couple 
ofyears. For about $800 million, less than the price of two Space 
Shuttle missions, NASA was able to sent two landers, each with a golf 
cart sized rover, to Mars and operate them for a couple of months. These
 MER rovers actually lasted well beyond their design lifetime, and for a
 modest increase in budget they were operated for an even longer period.
 The result of all this has been that manned spaceflight has become 
somewhat stuck in low Earth orbit after the Apollo Moon landings ended .
 Since the last few astronauts gathered their Moon samples and stepped 
into their lunar module to return home, we have been operating the Space
 Shuttle and Soyuz vehicles, as well as several space stations, but gone
 no higher than a couple ofhundred kilometers above the atmosphere. For 
the last 30 years, flying any further has simply been deemed too 
difficult, too risky and too costly. Robotic space probes, however, have
 long since visited all the eight major planets, flown through comet's 
tails, landed on asteroids, driven over the surface ofMars and explored 
the edges of the Solar System. It is a matter of fact that, until now, 
unmanned spacecraft have taught us far more about the Universe than 
human missions. Nevertheless, there are good reasons for sending humans 
to Mars and beyond, such as the fact that people always want to visit 
places themselves and that crewed space flights are better than robotic 
missions for inspiring young people to study sciences. Looking at 
pictures from Mars taken by unmanned rovers is like having a look at the
 Grand Canyon through a webcam on the Internet; it is easy, relatively 
cheap and safe but does not otTer the same experience as actually being 
there. In the future, some of us may even choose to live on Mars: to 
increase the survival ofour species in case ofa global disaster on our 
mother planet; to expand our civilization; to gain access to the raw 
materials available on the planets and asteroids; to push our 
technological capabilities; or just to have the adventure . In such 
cases, we should regard our robotic probes as scouts that tell us 20<br>
<br>
 Introduction what lies ahead and can go where we yet fear to tread. 
They can test technologies that are currently too novel and too risky 
for integration in crewed spacecraft design. ESA's Aurora program 
provides a good example. It is a roadmap that involves a series of 
increasingly complicated robotic Mars missions, starting with relatively
 simple demonstration landers and orbiters and evolving to a Mars Sample
 Return mission that brings Martian soil back to Earth. Each mission 
will result in more scientific knowledge about the red planet, but 
moreover will be part of a technology development plan leading to a 
human mission to Mars sometime around 2035. Human and robotic space 
exploration should not be in competition, but rather be regarded as 
complementary elements of the same push of humanity into space.<br>

HE term "robot" is derived from a Czech word meaning "forced labor," and
 got its modem meaning from the 1920 play "R.U .R." (Rossum's Universal 
Robots) by Czech playwright Karel Capek. Simply said, a robot is a 
mechanism that works according to logical, programmed rules. According 
to this definition, all spacecraft are robots, and robots have now been 
exploring the Solar System for nearly half a century . In Capek's play, 
robots develop emotions and overthrow their human masters. Fortunately, 
for now space robots are doing what we want (save for malfunctions) and 
emotions are not part of their extensive array of capabilities. If we 
order them to, they will plunge into certain destruction without a hint 
of concern or care. They are incapable of being angry or scared, and 
cannot object, strike or revolt. Another thing they cannot do is to 
procreate; leave two of them in the same room and there will still be 
two many years later. Instead, space robots originate from people's 
imagination and our continuous yearn for knowledge. We are the robots' 
creators. We decide on their goals in life 23<br>
<br>
 Chapter 2 and tell them what to do. If they could think, they would 
consider us to be their gods (actually the theme ofthe first Star Trek 
movie, in which a vastly enhanced Voyager probe returns to Earth to meet
 its "Creator"). Space probe mission plans usually start out as a 
scientific need for information about one of the many fascinating places
 in the Solar System. There are many targets to choose from: the Sun, 
the eight major planets, Trans-Neptunian objects, hundreds of small and 
large moons, asteroids and comets. Scientists may want to study the 
composition of those beautiful rings of Saturn, or find out whether 
there really is an ocean of liquid water hiding beneath the thick ice 
ofJupiter's moon Europa. All scientific knowledge we gain about one part
 of the Solar System relates directly to everything else we know or want
 to learn about our place in the Universe . The crushing carbon dioxide 
atmosphere ofVenus (surface pressure: 90 atmospheres; average surface 
temperature: 480 degrees Celsius/900 degrees Fahrenheit) shows us what 
could have happened to our Earth had it evolved a little closer to the 
Sun. In contrast, Mars shows us what happens if a planet is a little 
smaller than Earth and receives a little less warmth: the atmosphere has
 all but escaped the low gravity of the planet and what was once liquid 
water is now imprisoned as ice below the surface. The information we ask
 our robotic science explorers to collect about the Solar System and the
 Universe is related to the most fundamental questions we want to 
answer: Why did life begin on Earth? Was it just a matter of chance, or 
an inevitable result of the planet's favorable position and chemistry? 
Was there ever life on Mars, maybe when that place was a lot warmer and 
liquid water freely flowed over its now barren, rusty surface? Did life 
start anywhere else in the Solar System? And what do the answers to 
these questions tell us about the chances for other intelligent life in 
the Universe? Early wish lists and musings about what questions should 
be answered, and what data we need to be able to do that, are translated
 in a set of realistic objectives and requirements for a new space probe
 mission. Based on these, scientists and engineers together make a 
preliminary design: what the spacecraft should approximately look like, 
what it could do and what would be needed in terms of technology, time 
and money to make it happen. As you will see, the design of the 
spacecraft and its mission go through various stages during its 
development. At each stage the level of detail in the design increases 
and the new mission comes a bit closer to reality.<br>

 A Space Robot is Born<br>
<br>
SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTION Nowadays the first spark that starts a new space 
probe project comes mainly from space scientists. For instance, a group 
of planetologists (scientists who study planets) may be trying to figure
 out how the Solar System originally formed . They think it started as a
 huge cloud ofgas that collapsed under its own gravity. At the center of
 this contracting cloud the pressure and temperature rose steadily, 
eventually triggering nuclear fusion reactions that released enormous 
amounts of energy: the Sun began to shine. The remaining gas and dust 
collapsed to a flattened disk around the new, young star. Everywhere in 
this disk dust particles collided and coalesced, growing in size to form
 mini-planets, called planetesimals, from which the planets themselves 
eventually formed. Closest to the Sun, where temperatures were highest, 
the four planets made of rocks and metals appeared: Mercury, Venus, 
Earth and Mars. Farther out, where temperatures were lower, great 
spheres of gas accumulated around rocky cores (jupiter and Saturn) or 
cores made of rock and ice (Uranus and Neptune) . In the coldest outer 
reaches of the Solar System, icy materials collected to form relatively 
small bodies. These became the Trans-Neptunian objects, including Pluto .
 The planetologists have modeled their theories in a computer program 
that simulates the contraction of the early disk of gas into planets. 
For some reason however, their computer models cannot accurately predict
 how the planets closest to the Sun, including our Earth, were born. 
There is vital information missing about what the inner Solar System 
looked like some 4.6 billion years ago. To continue their scientific 
endeavor they urgently need to know more about Mercury, the planet 
closest to the Sun. If they knew exactly what it was made of, they could
 tell what types of material were present near the Sun before the 
planets were born. If they could figure out whether the interior of the 
planet is still partly molten or has already completely solidified, they
 would know something about the time that has elapsed since Mercury was 
formed . Unfortunately, not much is known about Mercury. Because it 
orbits so close to the Sun, the planet is always near its blinding glare
 and can never be observed in a dark sky from Earth. Pointing the famous
 Hubble Space Telescope at Mercury is not possible, because direct 
sunlight accidentally entering the telescope could easily damage the 
delicate optics and electronics inside. Sending space probes to visit 
Mercury is also difficult because it requires 25<br>
<br>
 Chapter 2 a lot of propellant to reach it, and spacecraft going so 
close to the Sun get very hot . Only one probe, NASA's Mariner 10, has 
so far visited the little planet. It swiftly flew past Mercury three 
times in 1974 and 1975, returning the only close-up images of the planet
 we have. And those pictures cover no more than 45 percent of the 
surface. Clearly, a new, more sophisticated spacecraft needs to be sent 
to Mercury to answer the questions that are burning in the minds of our 
motivated planetologists. Mter clearly defining what they need to know 
about Mercury, the scientists form a first idea about the types 
ofinstruments that are required. A set of sophisticated cameras can show
 them what the surface looks like. Moreover, by counting the number of 
impact craters on the pictures, the scientists could then roughly 
determine the age of the surface of Mercury. This would give an 
indication of when Mercury cooled off and became a solid planet. 
Unfortunately, cameras alone cannot tell us what Mercury is made of For 
that we need instruments called spectrometers, which can analyze the 
sunlight the planet reflects and thereby give information about the 
composition of the surface. A magnetometer instrument can measure 
Mercury's magnetic field. Earth has a strong magnetic field because it 
has a solid inner core (consisting mostly of nickel and iron) surrounded
 by an outer core of liquid metal, and a relatively fast spin rate. The 
resulting dynamo effect produces powerful magnetic forces. However, 
Mercury spins rather slowly and we expect its metal core to be entirely 
solid. It should not have a magnetic field at all, but nevertheless it 
does, even though it's about 100 times weaker than that of the Earth. 
Detailed investigations of this mysterious field may result in new 
theories about what's inside Mercury, and thus about the creation of 
planets in general. The choice of instruments leads to questions 
concerning the spacecraft itself: At what altitude should the probe and 
thus the instruments orbit Mercury? Stay too high and the cameras cannot
 see the amount of detail the scientists need . Go too low and the 
spacecraftmoves too fast across the surface, leaving insufficient time 
to scan areas in detail. In a very low orbit the spacecraft's field 
ofview is also too limited, making it hard to relate the small surface 
features it sees to the wider context of the planet. Moreover, if it's 
placed in too Iowan orbit the spacecraft may crash into Mercury. A 
circular orbit ensures that the probe is always at the same altitude 
above the surface, but takes a lot of propellant to achieve. A highly 
elliptical orbit is easier to obtain, but then the spacecraft's distance
 to the planet will continually change. That may be bad for the 
scientific observations, because the field ofview of the surface will 
constantly differ. On the other hand, close-up observations can be made 
during the part of 26<br>
<br>
 A Space Robot is Born the elliptical orbit closest to the planet, while
 the long time spent further away can be used to radio the fresh images 
to Earth. Maybe the scientists decide an orbiting spacecraft alone is 
not sufficient and they would prefer a lander to actually measure the 
composition of the soil on the surface. A lander can only make 
measurements at one spot, so perhaps a series oflanders needs to be 
spread all over the planet. However, too many spacecraft and landers 
would make the mission too expensive. In the end the scientists may 
decide they need to fly a satellite with a multi-wavelength camera 
system that maps the mineralogy and elemental composition ofMercury, and
 a magnetometer to measure the strength and structure of its magnetic 
field. They may also like to have at least one lander to investigate the
 surface on the spot. If the lander finds that, in its landing area, 
silicates are common in the soil, then this can be coupled with the 
remote-sensing data from the orbiter's camera. Wherever the orbiter's 
multi-wavelength camera sees the same "colors" as at the lander's site, 
the soil is bound to contain a lot of silicates as well. In such a way 
the remote-sensing data from the orbiter's camera can be calibrated 
using the very local findings of the lander. After a broad mission plan 
has been put together it has to be submitted to a government space 
agency to get funding for the development and operation. In the USA the 
scientists would try to get an agreement with NASA; in Europe they would
 contact ESA or a national space agency such as the French CNES, the 
German DLR or the Italian ASI; in Russia they would go to the Russian 
Space Agency; and in Japan they would go to<br>
<br>
JAXA.<br>
<br>
Experts in the space agency involved would normally look at the 
preliminary plan to see if it is worth studying further. Is the 
envisaged mission important enough to justify spending an important part
 of the nowadays limited budgets for space? Does it have good chance of 
success, or is it highly risky or based assumptions that are on too 
optimistic? Are there sufficient numbers of scientists backing the 
proposal? If the verdict is positive, the mission will go into the 
Conceptual Study phase, and a first rough design of the spacecraft and 
its mission will be put together. Considerations such as those described
 above have actually led to plans for two new, complex space missions 
called Messenger and BepiColombo. Messenger, for MErcury Suiface, Space 
ENvironment GEochemistry and Ranging, is a NASA mission that consists of
 a single orbiter. It will investigate the surface and magnetic field of
 the planet, and will look for traces of water-ice that may exist deep 
inside the permanently shadowed craters at the poles. Messenger will map
 nearly the entire planet in color ,<br>

 A Space Robot is Born including most of the areas that could not be 
seen by Mariner 10. It will also measure the magnetosphere, and the 
composition of both the surface and the extremely tenuous atmosphere . 
Messenger should provide us with the first new data from Mercury in more
 than 30 years. As Mercury orbits much closer to the Sun than Earth 
does, Messenger will have to lose velocity to spiral down toward the Sun
 and reach the planet. Moreover, once there it needs a lot of thrust to 
get into a nice, relatively low circular orbit . Using an onboard rocket
 engine for all of this would take a lot ofpropellant and therefore make
 the spacecraftvery heavy and large. As a result, it would become too 
costly and also require a very large, powerful and thus expensive 
launcher. To stay within budget, Messenger instead uses some peculiar 
orbital maneuvers called "gravity assists." A gravity assist maneuver 
means that a spacecraft swings by a planet and uses that planet's 
gravitational field and orbital velocity around the Sun to pick up or 
lose speed. In essence, the spacecraft uses some of the planet's energy 
for its own speed changes. Since the planets are much, much more massive
 than a spacecraft and thus have vastly more orbital energy, this 
parasitic behavior has no measurable effect on the planet's orbit. 
However, for the spacecraft the "stolen" energy can be used for large 
velocity and orbit direction changes. In case the energy is used for 
increasing speed, the situation can be somewhat compared to a ping-pong 
ball hitting a revolving fan, which will bounce back at a much higher 
speed than the speed at which you threw it. Another analogy is that of a
 car picking up speed by freewheeling down a steeply inclined road, but 
instead of the Earth's gravity, the probe uses the gravity of another 
planet. Messenger will use the principle in reverse to lose enough 
velocity so that its new orbit matches that of Mercury around the Sun . 
It's like a car slowing down by driving up a steeply inclined road. 
After launch, Messenger will circle the Sun and return to Earth for its 
first gravity assist maneuver in August 2005, then fly past Venus in 
October 2006 and again in June 2007 (see Figure 2.2). These smart, 
propellant-saving maneuvers come at a price, however ; although the 
probe has been launched in August 2004, it will not arrive at Mercury 
before 2011. The multiple sweeps past Earth and Venus consume a lot of 
time. BepiColombo is ESA's mission to Mercury and in its current design 
consists of two separate orbiters that are planned to be launched in 
2012. One spacecraft will be dedicated to imaging the planet, while the 
other will mainly study Mercury's magnetic field from another orbit. 
Initially, there were plans to include a lander as well, but that was 
found to make the mission overly complex and costly (see Figure 2.3). 29<br>

The project is named after professor Giuseppe (Bepi) Colombo, who lived 
from 1920 to 1984 and dedicated his life to detailed studies of Mercury 
and interplanetary spacecraft trajectories. His authority was widely 
recognized. When in 1970 Guiseppe was invited to participate in a NASA 
conference on the planned Mariner 10 mission, he realized that after 
flying by Mercury, the period of the spacecraft's orbit would be very 
close to twice the orbital period of the planet. In the time it took the
 spacecraft to make one orbit around the Sun, Mercury would have gone 
around twice. He suggested that, if the initial fly-past point could be 
carefully selected, the two could meet each other more than once . NASA 
adopted his brilliant idea, and eventually Mariner 10 made three flybys 
of Mercury in 1974 and 1975. Thanks to Guiseppe Colombo's orbital 
calculations, the spacecraft was able to collect far more scientific 
data than would have been possible during a single encounter. For ESA 
the BepiColombo mission is very special, as most of its previous 
interplanetary missions have gone outward, to the relatively cold parts 
of the Solar System. Instead, BepiColombo will be flying into the really
 "hot" inner regions where the Sun's radiation threatens to fry a 30<br>

 Chapter 2 spacecraft. ESA's only other spacecraft that was sent that 
way was Venus Express, but BepiColombo will get much closer to the Sun. A
 satellite orbiting the Earth receives about 1,400 watts per square 
meter (10.5 square feet) of energy from the Sun's radiation; enough to 
light 14 lamps, each of 100 watts, in your house. At Mercury the 
radiation energy can be five to 10 times more, depending on how close 
the planet is to the Sun in its highly elliptical orbit. This abundance 
of irradiation poses some challenging technical problems . The sides of 
BepiColombo and Messenger that face the Sun will have to withstand 
extremely high temperatures, while, at the same time, those that face 
empty space will be exposed to incredibly low temperatures. Mercury's 
surface is also heated by the Sun, reaching temperatures up to 450 
degrees Celsius (840 degrees Fahrenheit) . The heat emitted by the 
planet into space, and thus onto the spacecraft, can also create thermal
 problems. Special materialsare needed to prevent outside antennas and 
solar arrays from melting, and Messenger even hides behind a ceramic 
sunshade to protect it from the Sun. ESA, the European Space Agency, is a
 very international organization with 17 member states: Austria, 
Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, 
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, 
Switzerland and the United Kingdom, with associated members Canada and 
Hungary participating in some projects under cooperation agreements. 
Each of these countries will develop and build equipment for the imaging
 orbiter of BepiColombo. However, this project will be even more 
international, as the orbiter for studying the magnetosphere will be 
completely developed and built by Japan. BepiColombo is planned to use 
not only gravity assists from the Moon, Earth and Venus to reach 
Mercury, but also a very efficient propulsion system that needs much 
less propellant than the conventional chemical propulsion systems used 
by Messenger. In the current baseline designs, BepiColombo uses 
"electric propulsion." The use of this for interplanetary flights is 
rather innovative, and therefore needs to be tested before BepiColombo 
can be designed with confidence. Electric propulsion and the special 
spacecraft built to test it is the subject of the next section.<br>

PROVING TECHNOLOGY Most modern interplanetary space missions have a 
primarily scientific motivation. However, sometimes it is technology, 
not science, that is the main goal of the mission. ESA's SMART 1 is such
 a project. Although the SMART 1 probe flew to the Moon, the main 
requirement for the mission is to test and demonstrate new technology. 
SMART stands for "Small Missions for Advanced Research in Technology," 
and SMART 1 is the first in what should become a series of technology 
demonstration satellites. The 370-kilogram (820-pound) SMART 1 carries a
 suite of miniaturized scientific instruments that are making an 
inventory of the key chemical components of the lunar surface. Even 
after the explorations by the Apollo astronauts on the Moon in the 1960s
 and 1970s, there is still a lot of vital information missing about the 
Moon's composition . Without this, we cannot determine how our neighbor 
in space has been created. Is the Moon formed from debris of a violent 
collision of a small planet with the young Earth? Or has it formed<br>

 Chapter 2 somewhere else in the Solar System and later been captured by
 the gravity of our planet, imprisoning the Moon in a tight orbit around
 the Earth? The main innovation of the SMART 1 mission is, however, its 
revolutionary propulsion system. Where most interplanetary probes rely 
on propellant-hungry chemical rocket engines, SMART 1 is testing a much 
more efficient electric propulsion system called an "ion engine." The 
technology was pioneered by NASA's Deep Space 1 mission, but had not yet
 been thoroughly developed and tested in Europe. Ion engines make use of
 an effect that was discovered by the American physicist E.H . Hall in 
1879. He observed that when an electric current (through a wire) flows 
across a magnetic field, it creates an electric field<br>
<br>
FIGURE 2.5 The ion propulsion thrusterofESA 's SMART 1 spacecraft. Ions

<br>
directed sideways to the current. When electrically charged atoms, 
called ions, are placed in this electric field, they can be accelerated 
to great speeds. The ion engine of SMART 1 uses the inert gas Xenon as 
propellant . The atoms of this gas are ionized and then shot out in a 
constant flow. Owing to the "action = reaction" principle explained in 
Chapter 1 of this book, the Xenon ions shooting out of the engine push 
the spacecraft forward. In an ion engine, the gas is ejected at a much 
higher velocity than in a normal chemical rocket: an engine burning 
liquid propellants may shoot out hot gasses at 4.4 kilometers (2.7 
miles) per second, but SMART l's ion engine expels its charged atoms at 
more than four times this speed. Because of this higher ejection 
velocity, ion engines are much more efficient and thus need much less 
propellant. The propellant savedmeans that more space and mass are 
available for scientific instruments; it also means that interplanetary 
spacecraft can be made smaller and lighter than before. On SMART 1 the 
energy needed for the ion engine comes from its solar panels, which 
convert sunlight into electricity. The technique employed by SMART 1 is 
therefore officially called "solar-electric propulsion. " SMART l 's ion
 engine is very efficient. Flying to the Moon, the little spacecraft 
traveled 84 million kilometers (52 million miles) with a fuel 
consumption ofless than 2 million kilometers per liter (4.7 million 
miles per gallon). However, there is a catch when using solar-electric 
propulsion: ion engines are amazingly propellant-efficient but only give
 a very low thrust. It's like driving a car with an extremely economical
 but not very powerful engine, going 500 kilometers (310 miles) on one 
liter of gasoline but at a maximum speed of only 30 kilometers (18 
miles) per hour. SMART l 's engine pushes the spacecraft with a force of
 only 7 grams - less than the weight of a postcard. This extremely low 
thrust results in a very low acceleration of the spacecraft; each 
second, with the engine on, SMART 1 increased its velocity by only 0.2 
millimeter (0.01 inch) per second. With a couple of short boosts from a 
conventional rocket engine you can reach the Moon in a couple of days, 
but it took SMART 1 16 months to get there. The gentle push meant that 
SMART l's ion engine had to work for the entire duration of the 
transfer, slowly increasing the diameter of its orbit around the Earth 
until it reached the Moon. One of the most important tests of the 
mission was to see whether the engine could really work continuously for
 over 16 months. SMART 1 had to fly 332 times around the Earth before 
finally attaining lunar orbit. 35<br>
<br>
 Chapter 2 If the study of the Moon had been the primary goal, it could 
have been done faster and cheaper with a simple spacecraft based on a 
conventional chemical rocket system. The requirement to test electric 
propulsion makes SMART 1 a very unconventional lunar mission. Ultimately
 the reason for developing and testing new technology on board SMART 1 
is to make future space missions with electric propulsion possible with 
lower risks and at lower cost. What we learn from SMART 1 can be applied
 to larger, purely scientific missions such as BepiColombo, which will 
go much further than the Moon. Putting experimental, untested technology
 on board an expensive mission such as this would be too risky, but 
through SMART missions the new technology is mastered and becomes 
"flight proven ." SMART 1 is thus not a stand-alone mission, but part of
 a grand, comprehensive plan of future interplanetary exploration.<br>
<br>
THE POLITICAL PUSH Sometimes it is not only the pure scientific or 
technical issues that define the requirements. During the space race of 
the 1950s and 1960s, politicians and military planners had a strong 
influence on which missions got funding and what the spacecraft needed 
to do. At that time, prestige and propaganda were very important - and 
often more important than the scientific benefits. If your country was 
the first to land something on the Moon, you would make the 
international newspaper headlines and gain the admiration of the world, 
even if your probe hardly carried any scientific instruments. In the 
early stages of spaceflight, merely hitting the Moon was a major 
achievement, and one that could be exploited politically. The Soviet 
Union and America both tried to show the rest of the world that their 
social and economic systems were the best. One way ofproving that was by
 superior technical achievements, such as landing on the Moon or flying 
past Mars. Moreover, ifyour rockets were able to hit the Moon, that 
demonstrated that you were certainly also capable of hitting your 
enemy's territory on Earth with nuclear missiles. Space missions could 
be used to showcase Cold War military power without actually hurting 
anyone. Nowadays the political push behind space missions is much less 
strong and a lot more benign. Complicated space projects are a great way
 to strengthen the ties with other nations through international 
collaboration. 36<br>

Many American interplanetary spacecraft carry scientific instruments 
from Europe, and vice versa. NASA's Cassini spacecraft carried ESA's 
Huygens probe to Saturn and released it to investigate the mysterious 
atmosphere of its largest moon, Titan, and ESA's BepiColombo mission to 
Mercury will include a Japanese orbiter. Apart from using NASA's own 
Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey orbiters, the NASA Marsrovers 
"Spirit" and "Opportunity" could communicate with Earth via ESA's Mars 
Express orbiter. The British Marslander "Beagle 2," carried on board 
Mars Express, would have been able to communicate via its European 
mother ship as well as both NASA orbiters (unfortunately something went 
wrong on the way down to the Martian surface, and Beagle 2 was lost). 
Moreover, ESA itself is a group of European member states that together 
finance, develop, launch and operate spacecraft. All its projects are 
highly cooperative and international undertakings . Spacefaring nations 
also help each other by offering their radio ground stations to 
communicate with other nations' space probes. No country is so large 
that its receivers can always be in the right position to pick up the 
signals from its own interplanetary spacecraft; because of the rotation 
of the Earth it will have to depend on stations in other countries to 
relay communications during "black-out" periods. Yet another way of 
cooperating is to offer a free launch on one ofyour rockets for someone 
else's spacecraft - in return, of course, for access to the scientific 
results of the mission. As there is no such thing as a "free lunch" in 
commercial business, nor is there a "free launch" in space business.<br>

PAPER SPACECRAFT Once a general idea for an interplanetary space 
rrussion has been formulated and accepted, the real hard work begins. 
The initial idea, which may be nothing more than a couple of pages with 
scientific objectives and requirements , needs to be worked out in 
detail. First, a list of technical requirements is derived from the 
scientific requirements. For instance, the scientists may want to have a
 robotic rover driving over the surface ofMars to investigate the rocks 
there . A technical requirement following from this is that a system 
needs to be developed to land the rover softly on Mars. Moreover, the 
fact that the rover will be on Mars results in technical requirements 
about the minimum and maximum temperatures the rover must be able to 
survive while on the surface. From previous Marslanders and orbiters we 
now know that the coldest temperature on the surface is about - 140 
degrees Celsius (-220 degrees Fahrenheit) at the polar caps, while it 
gets no warmer than 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit) anywhere 
else. As this is too cold for the electronic equipment on board a rover,
 a heating system is required. Sometimes the technical requirements 
cannot be captured into such sharply defined parameters. For instance, 
when ESA's Huygens probe was designed to investigate the murky 
atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan, little was known about the 
temperatures and pressures a spacecraft would encounter. The probe had 
therefore to be designed to operate in a relatively wide range 
ofpossible atmospheric environments - which was a bit like designing an 
all-terrain car that has to be able to drive well on both asphalt roads 
and muddy sand paths. Moreover, if the probe would make it all the way 
to the surface alive, would it then hit a super-cold icy surface as hard
 as steel, or plunge into a bitterly cold lake of liquid hydrocarbon 
gas? Although Huygens was not specifically intended as a lander, 
scientific measurements from the surface would provide a valuable bonus 
to the mission. Huygens, therefore, should not only be able to land on 
hard, solid ground but should also be able to float, and in both cases 
be able to gather data. Starting from the scientific and technical 
requirements, the spacecraft's mass, the amount of electrical power 
needed to run all the scientific and supporting equipment, and the size 
of the probe needed to fit all the hardware and propellant have to be 
calculated. Moreover, experts need to precisely list the required types 
and numbers of sensors, solar cells, antennas, tanks, computers, etc. 
Typically the main issues the scientists and engineers need to tackle 
are 38<br>
<br>

<br>
how to make the probe as light and as small as possible, while, at the 
same time, achieving all the mission objectives. Robotic interplanetary 
spacecraft typically have a launch mass somewhere between 300 and 3,000 
kilograms (660 and 6,600 pounds), while their size may vary from that 
ofa washing machine to the dimensions of a large shipping container. In 
general, the smaller the spacecraft the less costly it is to develop and
 build. Moreover, the lower the mass and volume, the smaller and thus 
cheaper the rocket required to launch it. For each kilogram/pound you 
may save on your interplanetary space probe, you may save some 60 
kilograms/ pounds of propellant and 7 kilograms/pounds of launcher 
hardware. If you save enough on your spacecraft mass, this means you can
 switch to a smaller and cheaper launcher. As the launch price typically
 comprises 30 percent or more of the total mission cost, such savings 
are very important. Making your space probe small and light enough to 
fit inside a smaller rocket instead of a larger one easily saves you 
several tens of millions of dollars. Detailed questions to be answered 
during the spacecraft design work are, for instance: • How many 
propellant tanks should we fit, and what volume should they hold to 
carry all the propellant? • How many thrusters (small rocket motors) are
 enough to stabilize the spacecraft? • Where do we place the antennas so
 that at least one is positioned just right at any time to exchange 
radio signals with Earth? • How much surface area do we require for the 
solar arrays to make sure that, even if the efficiency of the solar 
cells degrades over time, we always have sufficient power to run all the
 onboard systems? Many times the scientists and engineers have to cope 
with conflicting requirements. For instance, to remain cool a spacecraft
 orbiting Mercury should stay in the planet's shadow as much as 
possible. If it didn't, its electronics would get fried very quickly. On
 the other hand, the spacecraft also needs sufficient sunlight to get 
enough electrical power from its solar arrays. The engineer designing 
the thermal control subsystem of the spacecraft wants to hide it behind 
Mercury all the time, while the engineer responsible for the electrical 
power supply would like it to be exposed to full sunlight as much as 
possible. Keeping the spacecraft in the shadow at all times means that 
it will receive no energy and will die when the battery eventually 
empties. Facing the Sun continuously requires very complex thermal 
protection with thick layers of insulation and large radiators. This 
would make the probe too heavy and too<br>
<br>
39<br>
<br>
 Chapter 2 large. Clearly, a compromise has to be found between the 
preferences of the thermal control engineer and the electrical power 
engineer. In addition, the scientists may have very strong requirements 
for the amount and direction of light they need for their cameras, and 
that must also be taken into account. The designing of space probes is 
not a garage project in which you just scribble a rough sketch on a 
napkin and start building almost immediately, working out the details as
 you go. This process only works in some game shows, where contenders 
have to quickly build machines from whatever they can find in the scrap 
yard, making adjustments as they progress and fixing problems or even 
modifying their design during the contest. Spacecraft are much too 
complicated for this. Let's say that you have started to build your 
robotic Jupiter explorer and later find that your battery is too small. 
You will have start again and incorporate a bigger one, which is of 
course also heavier. As a result, your spacecraft increases in mass, and
 therefore needs not only more propellant for its orbit maneuvers but 
also larger tanks. This makes the whole thing even heavier and larger, 
requiring the spacecraft's basic structure to gain weight. Also, you 
will need more thermal isolation material to cover the now larger 
spacecraft. Such snowball effects can quickly get out of hand. 
Furthermore, unlike most other machines, interplanetary probes cannot be
 repaired after launch. Broken equipment cannot be replaced, so spare 
units have to be actually built into the spacecraft. This is called 
"built-in redundancy." If something breaks along the way, such a backup 
system may take over from the failing equipment, but otherwise there is 
not much you can do about it. The spacecraft is far out, and gone 
forever. Your only link with it is via radio communication. Spacecraft 
therefore need to be carefully designed on paper (or in computers 
actually) before anything can be built, bought or constructed. Mistakes 
made early in the project can come back to haunt you years later, during
 the detailed development, construction, testing or even when the 
spacecraft is already flying through space. Designing spacecraft is not a
 linear process where you start with some requirements and then simply 
follow a list ofthings to calculate and decide on. Instead, space probe 
engineers work through so-called iterative "design loops." For instance,
 when you want to land something on Mars you will normally use 
parachutes. However, since the atmosphere of Mars is very thin, these 
may not brake your lander enough to prevent it from smashing into the 
rocky surface. You will need something else to slow the spacecraft down 
just before it reaches the ground.<br>
<br>
40<br>
<br>
 A Space Robot is Born<br>
<br>
There are two basic possibilities. One is to use a system of braking 
rocket thrusters to slow the lander down and softly place it in the red 
Martian dust in a fully controlled way. The benefits of this system are 
that you can land really carefully and that you always touch down with 
the right side up. The downside is that you will need a sophisticated 
control system, instrumentation to very precisely measure the altitude, 
and a lot of<br>

<br>
rocket propellant. The two Viking landers that NASA sent to Mars in the 
mid-1970s were based on this system. The other method is to enclose your
 spacecraft inside a cluster of airbags (similar to those used in cars) 
that inflate immediately before hitting the surface, and just let your 
lander fall, bump and roll until it stops. This results in a much 
simpler, smaller and lighter system than the use of braking rockets. 
However, even with the baggy protection the landing is relatively hard; 
the lander has to endure something that can be compared to pushing your 
computer from a chair onto the floor here on Earth. Because you lander 
has been bouncing over the surface, it is shaken quite a bit, and if 
your spacecraft is heavy the airbags have to be enormous. Moreover, you 
can never be sure which side is up when the thing finally stops, so the 
lander has be able to right itself mechanically if it is upside down. 
The famous 1997 NASA Mars Pathfinder used this system for the first 
time, with success. The lander hit the Martian surface with a total 
velocity of about 65 kilometers (40 miles) per hour; approximately 45 
kilometers (28 miles) per hour in the vertical and 45 kilometers (28 
miles) per hour in the horizontal direction. It then bounced some 15 
meters (50 feet) into the air, bounced another 15 times and rolled over 
and over before finally coming to rest about 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) away
 from the initial impact<br>
<br>

<br>
site. It had been rolling and bouncing for some 2.5 minutes. More 
recently, the two NASA Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity 
were safely landed with airbags. To make a trade-off on which of these 
possibilities to use, you could make two preliminary designs: one with a
 rocket system like Viking and one with airbags like Pathfinder. You 
could then evaluate the complexity and estimate the masses, sizes and 
costs for each option and compare them with the original list of 
requirements for the maximum launch mass, maximum cost and maximum 
landing speed. The one that best fits the requirements is the winner of 
the little Darwinian competition. However, often the trade-offs are not 
as straightforward as in this example. In his Akin's Laws of Spacecraft 
Design, professor David Akin of the University of Maryland comments: 
"There is never a single right solution. There are always multiple wrong
 ones, though." After all major trade-offs have been made, you can 
design the chosen concept in more detail. When you have checked the 
outcomes with the requirements for maximum mass, maximum landing speed, 
etc., you have finished the first design loop ofyour new space project. 
If the concept does not entirely fit the requirements, you will have to 
do another design loop involving changing your design, recalculating 
everything and comparing the new numbers with the requirements. If you 
did it right, your updated design will fit the requirements better than 
the earlier concept. Sometimes there is no way to nicely adhere to all 
the requirements. Your concept may fit the mass and volume demands but 
be much too expensive. Or it may be too complex to build within the 
specified timeframe. It has then to be determined whether the 
requirements themselves need to be changed, or whether the project must 
be branded " not feasible. " No design is complete without a development
 schedule plan that shows when to start the development and production 
of a part of the spacecraft, and when that part needs to be finished. 
It's no use testing the spacecraft's telecommunication subsystem if the 
transmitter is not ready yet; it would be like trying to test drive a 
car while the engine is still being assembled in the garage. Just like 
an orchestra, where each musician has to be at the same page of the 
music book and every instrument has to start at the right time, the 
development and production phases of all parts of a spacecraft need to 
be harmonized. The entire development of an interplanetary robotic probe
 takes about three years minimum, but large and complex spacecraft may 
take as long as eight years to be ready for launch . These long 
development times mean that when they are launched, space probes often 
contain equipment that is 43<br>
<br>
 Chapter 2 already obsolete. When you take into account the projected 
very long travel times, spacecraft are often fairly antiquated by the 
time they reach their destination. When the Huygens probe entered the 
atmosphere of Saturn's moon, Titan, in January 2005, it had been on its 
way for over seven years, while its development actually started in the 
late 1980s. That meant that the technology descending through that 
strange Titan atmosphere actually dated from the time we were running 
Microsoft Windows 2.0 on 386 computers! While designing the spacecraft 
for minimum mass, volume and complexity, the risk of failures always 
needs to be taken into account. Is one onboard computer enough? What 
ifit breaks? Maybe you need to put in a backup, but would that make the 
probe too heavy? What is the chance that one of the two foldable solar 
arrays does not deploy properly? Do you design the spacecraft so that it
 can operate with only one solar array, and use the second one only as a
 backup? Or do the scientists accept that if one solar array does not 
work, they will need to operate the scientific instruments only part 
ofthe time and thus obtain less valuable information? The level of risk 
is evaluated by looking at the combination of impact and likeliness of 
something going wrong. The impact of aliens hi-jacking your space probe 
on its way to Mars would, for instance, be very high, because if that 
happens the mission would be completely lost. However, the probability 
of such an abduction is extremely small. The risk, as function of the 
impact and likeliness, is negligible because the high impact is nearly 
nullified by the extremely low probability of occurrence. In contrast, 
the chance that a piece of electric wire will get damaged during the 
construction of the spacecraft is rather high, but the impact is very 
low. You just keep some inexpensive spare wire at hand to replace it. 
Risks with a relatively high impact and likeliness need to be dealt with
 by, for example, having some reserve money included in the development 
budget to buy replacements for faulty equipment. Relatively high risks 
connected to equipment failure during the mission can be diminished by 
the earlier mentioned built-in redundancy - that is, having spares on 
board that can take over when needed. For instance, two radio 
transponders (combined transmitters and receivers) are usually included,
 because without the means of communication any spacecraft is rendered 
useless. Since this is now more or less standard practice, the two 
transponders often come integrated as one single box (this is called 
"internal redundancy") . Another way to lessen the risk of losing your 
mission is to design so-<br>
<br>
44<br>
<br>
 A Space Robot is Born<br>
<br>
called functional redundancy into the spacecraft, by ensuring that other
 types of equipment can take over the job of failing devices. For 
instance, when sensors that orient a spacecraft by pointing it at a 
certain star (socalled star trackers, see Chapter 3) break down, their 
function may be taken over by other types of sensors that aim the probe 
with the help of the Sun. There are also risks that are relatively high,
 but cannot really be dealt with. For instance, the chance that your 
space probe is lost due to a launch failure is not negligible, even 
after more than half a century of experience in launches. The impact 
would be extremely high, because when it happens the spacecraft will 
surely be destroyed. However, there is not much you can do about it; 
building a copy of your spacecraft to keep as a spare is much too 
expensive. It is a risk that cannot be neglected but just has to be 
accepted. The only thing you could do is to financially insure the 
project against a failed launch. Increasingly important in any space 
project is the planning of a solid financial budget . Has sufficient 
money been allocated to do the whole mission? What are the risks 
ofover-expenditure? Estimates ofthe costs for development, production, 
launch and operations of the probe have to be made, and have to be 
compared with the actual budget available. An average space probe, 
mostly based on existing and somewhat modified equipment, may cost 
something in the order of 100 million dollars for the basic equipment 
and another 50 million for the scientific instruments on board . The 
launch with a Soyuz rocket would cost at least 40 million dollars, and 
another 20 million dollars would be needed to track and control the 
spacecraft during flight. That's a total of 210 million dollars. A 
complex mission, requiring lots of new developments and carrying an 
extensive array of sophisticated instruments, can easily cost over a 
billion dollars (see Table 2.1). Spacecraft are usually unique; they 
need to be specifically designed for a certain mission and therefore 
normally only one is built of any type. Even equipment that can be used 
on more than one space probe, such as standardized solar arrays or 
antennas, is only built in small numbers . As a result, space probes do 
not benefit from the cost-reducing economies of mass production, such as
 we see with computers and cars. Moreover, the fact that no one can 
repair interplanetary spacecraft once they are launched, and that they 
have to operate for long periods in the hostility of space, means that 
only components ofvery high quality can be used. That may, for instance,
 mean that special electronic components need to be used that are 
especially resistant to disturbances by the higher radiation levels in 
space. Sometimes several tens of units of the same component need to be 
bought and tested, so that the best single unit can 45<br>

be identified. Only that one unit selected from the whole group may then
 be used in the actual spacecraft. However, sometimes costs can be 
reduced by building spacecraft out of left-over spare equipment and test
 models of other missions. When ESA's four Cluster spacecraft were all 
lost during the failed launch of the first Ariane 5 rocket, one nearly 
complete spacecraft test model and some spare equipment were used in 
building the replacement satellites of Cluster II. NASA's Magellan Venus
 orbiter even incorporated all kinds of equipment left over from several
 previous projects that had totally different mission objectives. 46<br>
<br>
 A Space Robot is Born Space projects are notorious for their initial 
underestimated costs (often done to insure that funding for new missions
 would be approved by politicians) and consequent overspending at a 
later stage. Few spacecraft ever get finished under budget; most need 
additional funding as the development progresses and the project is 
found to be increasingly expensive . However, more and more space probes
 are "built to cost," meaning that the maximum financial budget is set 
before the designing of the spacecraft is started. If the cost estimates
 for the first design indicate that it would probably cost more to 
develop than is allowed, the probe needs to be redesigned until it fits 
the budget. Often it means that the scientific return of the mission is 
lowered, for instance, by deleting instruments from the spacecraft to 
make it lighter, simpler, smaller and thus cheaper. There is an 
important difference in how projects are funded between NASA and ESA. 
NASA projects have to battle for money through the federal budget each 
fiscal year. This means that even though a project may have been getting
 sufficient funding for half a decade, there is no guarantee that there 
will be money to complete it in the following year. For ESA missions, 
the budget for the whole project is more or less secure once it has been
 given the go-ahead; the agency does not have to convince politicians of
 the need for further funding every year. However, if the initially 
allocated budget is found to be insufficient, political approval for 
additional money has to be obtained, of course. Most space scientists 
and project managers believe that ESA's way is better, at least for 
their nerves. Compared to how robotic explorers uniquely enrich our 
knowledge and understanding of the Universe, the financial investments 
required are actually quite small. The missions of the two Voyager 
spacecraft that showed Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune and its moons
 in unprecedented detail have cost each US taxpayer less than a simple 
lunch. And for the cost of a couple of beers per year the European 
citizens have been able to explore the Sun, the Moon, Venus, Mars, 
Saturn's moon Titan and Halley's comet. Today, NASA's total budget 
represents less than 1 percent of the total federal expenditures . Even 
at its peak, in 1966, the space agency's budget was only 5.5 percent of 
all the money spent by the US government. In Europe the ESA member 
states spend even less than the USA on space exploration. In the end, 
the design reports, blue prints and computer simulations must together 
show a design that is technically coherent, able to fulfill its 
scientific objectives with a reasonable amount of certainty, and can be 
developed and built in a reasonable time and for a reasonable budget .<br>

IT'S JUST A PHASE I'M GOING THROUGH In NASA and ESA, spacecraft projects
 go through a number of strictly defined phases during their 
development. The "Pre-Phase A" or " Feasibility" stage is the time 
during which a conceptual study is done. The spacecraft's general layout
 is determined, its mass and volume are calculated, the possible 
interplanetary trajectories are shown and the expected scientific return
 and chance of success are evaluated. If the design meets the 
expectations , it may be approved to move to "Phase A." During this 
preliminary analysis phase the design is specified in further detail: 
the exact trajectory the spacecraftwill take; when it needs to be 
launched and when it will arrive at its destination; the tests that need
 to be performed; the companies that will supply particular equipment; 
and many more details. Phase A ends with a preliminary plan on what the 
spacecraft will look like and how to develop, build, launch and operate 
it. In " Phase B" the design of the spacecraft is defined in 
considerable detail, down to the lowest level; requirements and 
schedules are defined for each sensor, thruster, antenna, mechanism, 
electric heater, etc. Most importantly, during Phase B the scientific 
instruments that will be flown on board the spacecraft are decided and 
the scientific or technical institutes (e.g. university departments, 
government laboratories, etc.) that will be responsible for them are 
determined. Space companies show their Phase B designs to the 
responsible space agency, and offer formal proposals for further work on
 the project. Usually several large companies propose different designs 
for the same project as Prime Contractor - that is, the company that 
will be responsible for the overall development leadership. Each of the 
competitors evaluates and proposes the subcontractors it will need to 
help to develop and supply the various equipment. In the end, the 
company with the overall best offer wins and gets selected by the space 
agency to proceed to the next phase of development as Prime Contractor. 
Even although their designs may be based on the heritage of very 
different family lines ofpreviously built spacecraft, probes designed 
for the same purpose by different companies often look very similar. 
That is because, out of the vast number of possible spacecraft 
configurations , usually only a handful of concepts hold the promise of 
achieving the mission objectives in an optimum fashion. It therefore 
often happens that space probe concepts based on the same requirements, 
but designed independently by company A and company B, look strikingly 
similar. It is not because they have been spying on each<br>
<br>
48<br>
<br>
 A Space Robot is Born other; it is because both are bound by the same 
laws of physics and have followed similar engineering logics. The 
greatest engineer of all, Mother Nature, shows the same consistency. 
Ichthyosaurs and dolphins are both animals optimized for living in the 
sea and chasing fish. Both have streamlined bodies and flip their 
powerful tails to achieve great speed. Neither is very big and thus 
agile enough to go after small, fast prey. Ichthyosaurs and dolphins 
share a very common way of living and therefore look very similar. 
However, dolphins are modem mammals, while ichthyosaurs were reptiles 
that have not been around for the last 90 million years. Same 
requirements and same configuration - in biology, this is called 
"convergence." Phase B is followed by "Phase CJD," the combined design 
and development phase during which the spacecraft concept is detailed 
down to the last nut and bolt, and the actual building of the spacecraft
 starts. Equipment like sensors, antennas, tanks and cables are put 
together to form subsystems for attitude and orbit control, propulsion, 
electrical power supply, data handling (computers), telecommunication, 
structures and thermal control. Once integrated with each other, these 
subsystems form a complete spacecraft. Usually equipment is not only 
built for the actual spacecraft, but also for various tests that are 
necessary during development. For instance, a fuel tank qualification 
model may be used for pressure tests. During such tests the pressure 
inside a tank is increased up to a level that is much higher than 
anything it would normally will have to cope with . The qualification 
tank may be tested to destruction to discover the exact limits of the 
design. The design of the actual flight model of the tank to be put on 
board the spacecraft can then still be improved if necessary. The 
equipment may then need to be tested with other equipment to find out 
how they operate together. A fuel tank model may, for instance, be 
integrated with test rocket thrusters and the necessary pipes, valves 
and propellant filters to evaluate the proper functioning of the whole 
propulsion system. Finally, all the equipment is assembled into a 
complete (test) spacecraft, which has to be tested as a whole . This is 
the topic of Chapter 4, "Building and Testing." Other tests may be 
necessary for other types of equipment. The more complex, new and 
challenging the design, the more tests and thus the more development and
 test models are needed . After Phase C/D is completed, the spacecraft 
is ready to be launched (Phase E), and start Phase F, its "Operations 
Phase." In addition, there is often a Phase G, the decommissioning phase
 that deals with the 49<br>
<br>
 Chapter 2 spacecraft's destination at the end of its life. Sometimes 
spacecraft are just left to continue their journey through space as 
inert pieces of metal, or as abandoned relics on the surface ofa planet.
 However, some missions don't just fade out because of empty batteries 
or lack of budget to continue operation, but have a much more exciting 
ending. More on this in Chapter 8, "Death of a Spacecraft." As the 
amount of detail and documentation increases with each development 
phase, so do the number ofpeople involved. A Pre-Phase A study may be 
carried out by a design team of 20 people, but when the project arrives 
in Phase C/D, hundreds of engineers, technicians, scientists, software 
programmers, documentalists, managers, secretaries, planners, contract 
officers and lawyers can be involved. For instance, during Pre-Phase A 
the preliminary design of the electrical subsystem may be carried out by
 one single expert . In Phase B the details may be carried out by a 
Solar Array engineer, a Battery expert, a Power Control and Distribution
 engineer, and a Harness designer who takes care of all the cabling 
needed to connect everything. In Phase CfD the Solar Array, Battery and 
the rest of the equipment are each designed, built and tested by 
specific contractor teams. Several hundred people may be involved in the
 project by then. Several times during the development and at the end of
 each official phase, the work performed until then is presented to the 
responsible space agency. The agency's technical, scientific and 
administrative experts will then go through all the available 
documentation to check that everything is in line with the 
specifications and that all the right analyses and tests have been done 
in the right way. Only when all the agency's experts are happy with the 
results of the review is the project ready to move on to the next 
development phase. A general problem for the designers and reviewersis 
that "if it looks good, it flies good," a maxim that more or lessworks 
in aircraft design is in no way valid for spacecraft. Due to their 
un-aerodynamic, blocky shapes with sharp edges and projecting antennas, 
space probes are seldom pretty. Only a deep and careful analysis can 
reveal whether a space probe is well designed. Such extensive reviews 
are a bit like exams for the spacecraft designers. However, they are not
 really intended as tests, but primarily as a means of finding problems 
and inconsistencies in the concept. The spacecraft design can then be 
improved before it is too late; Space probes are such complex machines 
that it is hard not to overlook anything, and space is a particularly 
unforgiving environment. A critical review by people who are not too 
involved in the project, and are therefore reasonably unbiased, is often
 crucial for its success. 50<br>
<br>
 A Space Robot is Born<br>
<br>
A classic illustration of what can happen if reviews and checks do not 
root out serious problems is that of NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter, which 
arrived at Mars in September 1999. U sing its main rocket engine for 
braking, it began to slow down to attain an orbit around the red planet.
 While doing this, the probe disappeared behind Mars as planned. 
However, when the spacecraft should have re-appeared there was only 
static noise on the radio-link. Mars Climate Orbiter was neither seen 
nor heard from again. Subsequent investigations concluded that the 
spacecraft had flown too low, plunged deep into the Martian atmosphere 
and burned up due to the heat of the aerodynamic shock caused by the 
collision with the denser air. A faulty look-up table embedded in the 
onboard computer software, which by mistake used imperial instead of 
metric units (pounds force instead of newtons), was found to be the 
cause of the disaster. This simple, but very important mistake should 
have been noted during the development, but was overlooked because of 
the meager budget available for such technical management and control 
issues. The cutbacks in spacecraft tracking from the ground, again to 
save money, meant that the problem was not even identified during the 
flight. Another good (or bad) example of insufficient development 
oversight is the maiden flight of Europe's new Ariane 5 launcher. The 
onboard inertial reference system, which tells the rocket where it is 
going, incorporated software from the launcher's predecessor, the Ariane
 4. However, the flight of an Ariane 5 is quite different from that of 
the older type of rocket. Specifically, the horizontal velocity early in
 the flight is much highe r. Due to the obsolete software, the inertial 
reference system thought it was inside an Ariane 4 instead of the much 
more powerful Ariane 5. When the horizontal velocity exceeded the 
pre-set Ariane 4 limits some 30 seconds after liftoff, both the main and
 the identical backup systems shut down. The launcher veered off course ,
 resulting in extreme aerodynamic forces that broke the Ariane 5 apart. 
The extensive reviews and tests carried out during the Ariane 5 
development program did not include adequate analysis and testing of the
 inertial reference system. This was a serious and costly mistake, 
because the launcher was alsocarryingfour expensivesatellites intended 
to investigate the Sun and its effect on the Earth's magnetic field 
(fortunately, updated copies of these "Cluster" satellites were later 
built and launched with success). If the initial plan for the mission 
can be viewed as the project's conception, then Pre-Phase A is the 
project's birth, Phase A resembles infancy and Phase B is its early 
childhood. 51<br>
<br>
 Chapter 2<br>
<br>
During Phase CfD the project goes through puberty: the design evolves 
into its final form and emerges as a grown-up, complete spacecraft. 
Through various tests the probe can get a taste of what real life in 
space will be like. However, when something goes wrong, its "parents" - 
i.e. the developing space agency and industries - are still there to 
help out. With the launch the probe enters its independent adult life, 
and can start to fulfill its promise and make its creators proud. As the
 parents can still be contacted over the phone (or radio in this case), 
the probe can tell them how it's doing, and can send back pictures of 
the exotic places it visits. It can even complain about aching 
mechanisms and ask for advice through the remote uploading of new 
software. Physically, however, the probe is then on its own.<br>
<br>

 ANA1r((][M]l( or A §fAC[E f[fi((][B3[E BOTIC space probes usually do 
not look like people or animals. Rather than resembling the 
human-looking science fiction movie robots C3PO and Data, they have more
 in common with the squat, cylindrical R2D2. Like this famous robot from
 Star Wars, our spacecraftnormally do not sport arms, legs, eyes and 
ears as we do, but they nevertheless function very well in their own 
special environment. Like living beings on Earth, each type of robotic 
space explorer is optimized for specific purposes. A swallow flies low, 
speeding and zigzagging between trees and village buildings, and 
snatches small insects out of the air. To enable it to do that, the 
bird's body is small and lean and it has short, narrow wings that allow 
rapid maneuvers. An eagle, on the other hand, is much larger and has 
long, broad wings with which it can soar high, and almost effortlessly, 
over vast open areas. Its eyes are powerful optical instruments that can
 spot a small deer or rabbit below. If it finds one, it dives down and 
employs its mass and long talons to grip its victim. Swallows and eagles
 are both birds. They have very similar body<br>

layouts, lightweight skeletons and feathers. Nevertheless, a comparison 
shows important distinctions that betray their very different ways 
ofliving. It is similar for spacecraft; although they broadly have the 
same types of basic equipment on board, probes designed to slowly 
radar-map cloudy Venus look different from those that make snapshot 
pictures of comets during fast flybys. For instance, probes exploring 
planets close to the Sun have relatively small solar arrays. With plenty
 oflight, only limited numbers of solar cells are needed to provide 
sufficient electrical power. In contrast, spacecraft sent toward the 
outer regions of the Solar System require very large solar arrays, or 
even need to use completely different systems for electrical power 
generation when incident light levels are too low for solar cells. If 
probes flying through open space are like different species of birds, 
then they differ from planetary landers as birds differ from fish. Many 
internal parts are the same, but nevertheless they look vastly 
different. Landers are compact and sturdy with legs and wheels; orbiting
 probes often have ungainly long, fragile antennas and solar arrays 
sticking out that would immediately break off if deployed on the surface
 of a planet. Nevertheless, however much robotic spacecraftmay differ, 
you will also find similarities if you look closely and deeply enough. 
Like animals and people, space probes need to know what is going on 
around them and be able to react to that. Spacecraft need to keep their 
own temperatures within comfortable limits to provide sufficient power 
to all their active parts and to Withstand the various forces and 
pressures they encounter. A space probe should also be able to move 
itself, with thrusters ifit is in space or with legs or wheels if it is 
on a planet with sufficient gravity. Moreover, a spacecraft needs to 
communicate with its controllers back on Earth, and it needs a computer 
brain to be aware of its environment and direct all its actions.<br>
<br>
BITS AND PIECES The various elements on board a space probe are 
organized into subsystems, which consist of equipment that can be 
further broken down into components. For instance, the electrical power 
subsystem consists of equipment such as solar arrays and batteries, 
which themselves are built up of such components as solar cells, solar 
array hinges and electrical wires. Like in an organism, all the 
subsystems and equipments on board a spacecraft influence each other and
 thus cannot be developed and built completely independently.<br>

FIGURE 3.2 A typical breakdown<br>
<br>

into subsystems andequipment.<br>
<br>
For instance, the design of the power subsystem has a considerable 
influence on the amount ofheat that is generated within the spacecraft 
(the more power goes around, the more heat the electrical equipment will
 give oft), and thus has a strong effect on the thermal control 
subsystem. Likewise, the size and, thus, mass of the solar arrays has to
 be taken into account in the design of the spacecraft's supporting 
structure. If the solar arrays need to be larger, the structure will 
have to be adapted to handle the increase in size and mass. Making 
things even more complicated is the fact that, to keep costs down, 
modern space probes often reuse as much existing equipment as possible. 
The use of tailor-made equipment optimized for a specific space mission 
is expensive and is thus often minimized. This means that spacecraft 
engineers need to be able to put together new probes for new missions 
from a good deal of existing equipment, much like building an entirely 
new toy car out ofthe standard Lego blocks from the box of another 
model. The Lego blocks you would prefer to use may not exist, in which 
case you'll have to take blocks that look something similar to your 
ideal building blocks and adapt your design to suit them. This approach 
was very successfully applied to ESA's Rosetta, Mars 56<br>
<br>
 Anatomy of a Space Probe<br>
<br>
Express and Venus Express missions. Specializedequipment developed for 
the large and expensive Rosetta comet chaser was reused for the smaller,
 low budget Mars Express and Venus Express spacecraft. The two Express 
probes may not have been ideally suited for their tasks, but they could 
be developed in a very short time and for a relatively low budget; Mars 
Express was developed for about 60 million euro (excluding instruments 
and Beagle 2 lander), but could easily have cost twice that amount if 
all equipment had to have been newly developed. When space science 
budgets are as low as they currently are, minimizing costs in this way 
can mean the difference between a less than optimized but flying mission
 and no mission at all. Most people know more or less what a typical 
satellite or interplanetary spacecraft looks like, but have basically no
 idea of how they actually work . It's like the medical profession in 
the Middle Ages, when doctors were very familiar with the outside 
appearance of people, but had only a rudimentary idea of what was 
inside. In the seventeenth century, scientists therefore started to 
dissect the bodies of dead people to find out what the internal organs 
looked like and how Mother Nature made all these parts work together. 
Often these scientific cutting sessions were held in small theaters, so 
that a larger audience of students and medics could learn the secrets of
 the human body. We still cannot design anything as complicated as a 
person's body, but all the dissecting and probing has given us a pretty 
good idea of how it all works. Now, let's do something on that same 
principle. Rather than trying to design a spacecraft ourselves, we will 
put a typical planetary orbiter probe on an imaginary dissecting table 
and inspect its different parts.<br>
<br>
POWER Looking at the outside of a great many space probes, some of the 
first things you notice are the solar arrays with their shiny blue solar
 cells. On most spacecraft they come in the form of two large wings; on 
others the solar cells are simply covering the spacecraft's body all 
around . The thousands of interconnected solar cells work together to 
convert sunlight into enough electricity to power all the electrical 
equipment and instruments on the space probe. While people and animals 
need food and air, spacecraft need electric power. 57<br>
<br>
 Chapter 3 The solar cells on space probes are not much different from 
those you may find on the roof of some houses, or those used to power 
your pocket calculator. The main difference is that those used in space 
need to be as efficient as possible to limit the size and mass of the 
solar arrays, and need to be protected with special cover glass to avoid
 damage by radiation. To produce sufficient power - in the order of a 
few hundred watts for small space probes to several kilowatts for the 
big ones - solar arrays usually need to be fairly large. Sometimes they 
fit on the main spacecraft body, but often the number of solar cells is 
too high for that. Moreover, the arrays may constantly need to be 
pointed to the Sun to assure an adequate power supply. This is why most 
spacecraft are equipped with deployable solar array wings. During launch
 they are folded close to the body of the spacecraft to make them fit 
inside the payload fairing of the launcher, but in space they are 
deployed like an accordion. Once unfolded, Solar Array Drive Mechanisms 
at the roots ofthe wings are used to rotate them and keep them aimed at 
the Sun while the probe moves through space. Sometimes there is a short 
period when the solar arrays cannot be pointed at the Sun - for 
instance, when the spacecraft needs to make a special maneuver or when 
it is in the shadow of a planet. A rechargeable battery is then needed 
to keep the electricity flowing until the Sun shines on the arrays once 
again. In any case a battery is needed to bridge the time between launch
 and the moment the solar arrays are deployed. Just like solar cells, 
such batteries are basically not very different from equipment commonly 
used on Earth . What makes them so special and expensive is the fact 
that they need to be highly reliable over a long time, because they 
normally cannot be repaired or replaced once the spacecraft has been 
launched. In the same way that veins and arteries transport blood to the
 various organs in your body, a so-called Electric Harness of power 
cables carries electricity from the batteries and solar arrays to the 
various powerdemanding spacecraft equipment. A typical space probe 
contains many kilometers or miles of cables. To ensure that the proper 
amounts of power get to the right places under the right voltages, a 
Power Control and Distribution Unit is included that works not unlike 
the way the heart manages the oxygentransporting bloodstream flowing 
around your body. When you demand more of your body than your lungs and 
heart can handle, you get tired and body functions start to shut down; 
your legs refuse to run anymore, and your arms can no longer lift those 
weights you 58<br>

were pulling in the gym. Likewise, a spacecraft's onboard computer will 
need to shut down equipment when the need for power is more than the 
solar arrays and the battery can provide. Power hungry scientific 
instruments are usually the first to be cut off, with the most vital 
equipment such as the onboard computer itself being partly put off only 
in extreme cases. Shutting down functions of the onboard computer is 
similar to your body shutting down parts of your brain in case of 
extreme fatigue: you faint to put your body and brain on low-power 
standby to prevent serious or permanent damage. Likewise, a spacecraft's
 computer may go to standby when power levels drop below a certain 
minimum. Sometimes spacecraft are deliberately put on low-power standby.
 This is called "hibernation," a kind of winter sleep that lets the 
spacecraft 59<br>
<br>
 Chapter 3 survive on a minimum of electricity, like a bear sleeping 
through the winter without eating or drinking. Hibernation is often used
 on an interplanetary spacecraftthat needs years of traveling through 
space to reach its destination. While hibernating, the spacecraft does 
not need to be pointed at the Sun continuously and the inactivity 
minimizes wear and tear on the onboard equipment during the long travel.
 It also minimizes the amount of manpower needed in the mission control 
and spacecraft tracking facilities back on Earth. This helps to limit 
the cost of running the spacecraft for such long missions. The more 
sunlight, the more electrical power a solar array of a certain size will
 be able to produce. That is why spacecraft moving closer to the Sun, 
like those sent to Venus or Mercury, normally require only rather small 
solar arrays. However, at a certain distance from the Sun, even before 
the orbit of Mercury, the temperature of the arrays can get too high 
because of the Sun's heat. Instead of being perpendicular, the solar 
arrays then have to be pointed at an angle to the Sun. In this way less 
heat radiation hits the array surface, but there is also less useful 
light for the solar arrays. The arrays have then reached their highest 
possible output; moving closer to the Sun means that the angle with the 
Sun has to be lowered even more, so no further benefit from the 
increasing amount of light will be possible. For probes flying outward 
from Earth and the Sun the situation is reversed. Spacecraft flying 
beyond Mars venture into the outer regions of our Solar System, where 
there is little light to enable the solar arrays to produce electricity.
 Instead of very large and heavy solar arrays, engineers can opt to 
equip such interplanetary probes with Radio-isotope Thermoelectric 
Generators, or R TGs. RTGs are very compact and very reliable power 
systems. They work on the thermo-electric principle that a voltage can 
be generated between two different conducting materials if they are each
 kept at a different temperature. In an R TG the temperature difference 
is created by the heat emitted from the natural radioactive decay 
ofplutonium (mostly nonweapons grade Plutonium-238), which is in the 
form of ceramic plutonium dioxide . Because R TGs produce a lot ofheat 
and radiation that can disturb other equipment, they are usually kept as
 far as possible from the main spacecraft body by putting them on long 
poles on the outside. With RTGs a space probe does not need sunlight or 
any other external source of energy. Apart from enabling missions to the
 dark outer reaches of the Solar System, they can also be used at places
 where the radiation would damage solar arrays. That makes R TGs ideal 
for use on a future<br>

 Chapter 3 orbiter to, for instance, 10, the volcanic moon that circles 
within the fierce radiation zones around Jupiter. R TGs would also be 
very practical on probes landing on planets where long nights, thick 
clouds and dust in the atmosphere prevent sufficient amounts of sunlight
 from reaching a spacecraft. The Viking landers that were put down on 
Mars in 1976 were equipped with R TGs . Without depending on solar cells
 that would slowly be covered by the dusty sand of Mars, the Vikings 
were able to operate for years. Future robotic explorers on Titan, the 
veiled moon of Saturn, may also need to depend on them. However, RTGs 
also have a serious disadvantage: they carry potentially dangerous 
amounts of highly radioactive material. The safety and security measures
 associated with the use of R TGs on a spacecraft such as the Cassini 
Saturn probe, which is now touring Saturn and its moons, are therefore 
very stringent and elaborate. First, technicians handling R TGs have to 
be very careful, and also work very quickly because they are only 
allowed to be close to R TGs for very short periods. According to 
European health and safety rules, people are only permitted to work with
 unshielded RTGs for a maximum of two minutes .. . for their entire 
life! That does not leave a lot of time for a technician to integrate an
 RTG into a spacecraft of course; after just two minutes another person 
will have to take over. RTG integration teams test on dummy equipment 
until they can install the dangerous units nearly as quickly as a 
Formula-1 pit stop team can change the tires on a racing car. There is 
also, of course, the chance that radioactive material will be spread 
around if something goes wrong during the launch . However, engineers 
have been very successful in considerably reducing the risk of any 
radioactive contamination in the event that a spacecraft carrying R TGs 
would suffer a catastrophic launch failure. Unlike nuclear reactors, 
RTGs are not based on nuclear fission and do not have moving parts. They
 consist of solid blocks ofmaterial that simply stay warm because of 
their internal nuclear energy. The plutonium in Cassini's three RTGs can
 only be dangerous ifit would somehow end up dispersed as a powder in 
the atmosphere and be inhaled by someone . Or if someone found a large 
piece and kept it as a souvenir. To prevent any possible dispersion in 
the atmosphere, Cassini's RTGs can withstand larger forces and more 
extreme heat than they could ever experience during a catastrophic 
launch failure or an accidental re-entry in the atmosphere. The first 
safetymeasure is that the radioactive fuel on board Cassini is in the 
heat-resistant, ceramic form of plutonium dioxide, which greatly reduces
 the chance ofthe material evaporating in a fire or during a re-entry.<br>
<br>
62<br>
<br>
 Anatomy of a Space Probe<br>
<br>
Next, the fuel is divided into 18 independent units, each of which has 
its own heatshield and impact shell to avoid the fuel from evaporating 
during re-entry or breaking into pieces when falling on the ground. 
Dividing the fuel into small units almost eliminates the chance that all
 the radioactive material could somehow end up in the environment (the 
downside is that all this separate packaging makes the R TG much 
heavier). Finally the individual fuel units are packed together in a 
shell with multiple layers of strong, heat- and corrosion-resistant 
protection materials. The R TG is designed to survive any disaster 
intact, so that it can be recovered without causing any problem to 
anyone . The USA has flown 23 missions with RTGs over the last 40 years,
 and they have seldom caused any problems. In 1964 an R TG with 1 
kilogram (2 pounds) of plutonium burned up while descending through the 
atmosphere after a failed launch . All the radioactive material was 
vaporized and spread throughout the atmosphere . Mter this accident it 
was decided to build future R TGs in such a way that they would remain 
intact when falling back to Earth . In 1968 two R TGs came down after 
another launch failure, but they were recovered intact and actually 
reused on another satellite. The Russians have a less satisfactory 
safety record with their R TGs . In 1978 a defunct radar spy satellite 
broke up over Canada, spreading 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of dangerous 
Uranium-235 chunks over a large part of the country. The US and Canadian
 authorities spent a couple of weeks searching 47,000 square kilometers 
(18,000 square miles) under harsh winter conditions to find all the 
fragments. In addition to this disaster, Soviet launch failures and 
re-entering satellites have been responsible for large amounts of 
radioactive material evaporating in the atmosphere . However, the chance
 that even the tiniest amount of plutonium from modern R TGs, such as 
those in Cassini, could ever end up in the atmosphere is remote. 
Moreover, in the extremely unlikely event that any plutonium does 
escape, the particles in the atmosphere would also have to be inhaled by
 someone and stay in that person's body for a long time to cause any 
danger. Even then, it is most likely that the amount of any such 
particles inhaled would still be far too small to cause any measurable 
damage. Because of the special measures taken, the risk that R TGs pose 
to your health during a launch is less than the risk that you could be 
hit by lightning or even a meteorite from space - and the chances of 
that happening are very low. In 1954, a woman in Alabama, USA , was 
actually 63<br>
<br>
 Chapter 3 struck by a meteorite. The 9-pound rock crashed through her 
roof, bounced off a radio, and hit her while she was sleeping on her 
couch. Luckily, because the stone ricocheted off several objects before 
striking her, she only had some bruises. More recently, In August 1992, a
 big meteorite disintegrated over Mbale, Uganda. A small fragment was 
slowed by the foliage of a banana tree before falling on a boy's head. 
Fortunately he was not injured . In spite of the extremely low public 
health risks involved, Cassini's R TGs made it the most vigorously 
opposed and defended spacecraft ever. Groups of anti- and, in reaction, 
pro-Cassini activists grew rapidly as the 1997 launch got near. Angry 
debates were held on websites, in newspapers and on television. One 
anti-Cassini protest at Cape Canaveral even resulted in the arrest of 27
 activists who tried to trespass on the launch base. In spite ofthe 
protests, the launch campaign continued unhindered, and Cassini was sent
 on its way as planned. However, the fight was not over yet, because the
 probe's trajectory included an Earth flyby in 1999, to pick up enough 
speed to make it to Saturn. This time anti-Cassini activists feared that
 the probe would inadvertently end up and bum in the atmosphere, 
releasing plutonium from its RTGs in the process. They put pressure on 
NASA and the government to abort the flyby and put the space probe on a 
trajectory away from Earth, but again their protests went without 
effect. The Earth flyby did happen as planned, increasing Cassini's 
speed by 5.5 kilometers (3.4 miles) per second. This was an important 
part of the total 21.4 kilometers (13.6 miles) per second it needed to 
accumulate during its four planetary flybys (twice past Venus, once past
 Earth and once past Jupiter). Without the critical Earth flyby Cassini 
would never have made it to Saturn, where it is now making amazing 
discoveries and returning beautiful pictures of Saturn's moons and 
rings. Both RTG and solar cell technology is continuously developed 
further. There are plans to integrate RTGs with equipment that does not 
use the heat produced to make electricity directly, but instead employs 
thermodynamic or chemical processes to run electricity generators. This 
can result in much higher efficiencies, so that less radioactive 
material is required in the spacecraft. At the same time, solar cells 
are developed that can operate with less light than normal. This will 
make it possible to use solar arrays as far away from the Sun asJupiter.
 We may seeJupiter probes in the near future that will not need any 
RTGs.<br>

COMMUNICATION Space probes are not alone in the Universe . They are part
 ofa "society" of engineers and scientists without whom the machine's 
life is meaningless. Interplanetary space probes need to be able to talk
 to us, to tell us how they are and send us the streams of data from 
their scientific instruments. Likewise, people in the mission's control 
room need to talk to the spacecraft to make it change its orbit, to 
switch on a certain instrument and point it at an interesting object or 
to help the probe to recover from unforeseen equipment failures. Contact
 with our robots in space is maintained via radio. Large groundbased 
parabolic dish antennas are used to sufficiently focus the energy of our
 transmissions so that they can be received by spacecraft hundreds of 
millions of kilometers distant.<br>

<br>
 Chapter 3 Space probes cannot carry such large antennas as that would 
make them impossible to launch . The signals they send us from deep 
space through their smaller antennas are extremely weak by the time they
 arrive on Earth . What we receive from the Cassini orbiter at Saturn 
for instance, is about 20 billion times weaker than the energy output of
 the tiny battery in a digital wristwatch. However, the same large 
ground-based antennas we use to send powerful signals can also work the 
other way around. Their huge dishes are used to collect as much of the 
diluted spacecraft radio messages as possible, and focus that data into a
 strong enough signal for our receivers to detect it. The type of 
communications equipment a space probe carries depends on the amount of 
data it has to send, the distance from Earth it will travel, the amount 
of available electric power on board, and equipment mass limitations. 
Antennas are the ears of a spacecraft. They are divided into three main 
groups: high-gain antennas (HGAs), medium-gain antennas (MGAs) and 
low-gain antennas (LGAs), comparable to the huge sound-collecting 
surface of the ears of a coyote, the medium-sized ears of a horse and 
the very small ears of a duck . However, unlike biological ears, 
spacecraft antennas are also used to send out signals. Spacecraft 
antennas are like ears and mouths, and these functions are often 
combined in the same antenna . The "gain" achieved by an antenna is a 
measure of the relative amount ofincoming radio power it can collect and
 the strength ofthe signals it can transmit to Earth. The higher the 
gain, the stronger the signals it can put out and the weaker the signals
 it is able to detect. When you look at the outside of an interplanetary
 space probe, the HGA is one of the things that will catch your eye. 
HGAs are dishes that look a lot like the giant parabolic antennas we use
 on Earth, but they are much smaller. Nevertheless, they are often the 
largest thing on the spacecraft. Like optical telescopes, HGAs can focus
 the radio waves they collect or send out, but their field of view is 
very narrow. For HGAs to work properly, they have to be accurately 
pointed to Earth. Fixed HGAs make it necessary to maneuver the whole 
spacecraft to aim the antenna. Other space probes have an HGA that can 
be independently steered with a mechanism, but this comes at the price 
of higher equipment mass and added complexity, of course. Galileo, the 
orbiter that explored Jupiter, had an HGA that consisted of as-meter 
(16-foot) diameter mesh stretched over 18 curved ribs. The benefit of 
this design was that the whole contraption could be folded up like an 
umbrella during launch on board the Space Shuttle, which enabled 66<br>

the use ofa larger diameter antenna than would normally have fitted in 
the Shuttle Orbiter cargo bay. However, when almost 18 months after 
launch NASA controllers tried to deploy the HGA, something went wrong. 
The procedure, tested on Earth years earlier, called for a set of 
electrical motors to drive the antenna ribs out from a central mast and 
thereby open the umbrella. Once fully deployed, the ribs would snap into
 place and Galileo would send a notice of success to the ground. It 
didn't. Within minutes after sending the deployment command, Galileo's 
flight team saw that, although electricity was flowing through the 
deployment motors , they were not turning. The antenna, crucial for 
transmitting the expected huge amounts of scientific data from Jupiter, 
was stuck. More than 100 people quickly got busy with testing, 
simulating, analyzing, consulting and reviewing, in order to find a way 
to get the antenna unfurled completely. They discovered that three or 
four of the antenna ribs suffered from friction between misaligned 
standoff pins and their sockets, and therefore got stuck to the central 
tower of the antenna. The first remedial action consisted of turning the
 antenna toward the Sun to warm and expand the central part of the 
antenna, which would hopefully free the stuck pins. When this didn't 
work, they tried<br>

 Chapter 3<br>
<br>
FIGURE 3.7 The astronauts' patch for shuttle mission STS-34 thatput the Galileo spacecraft on its way. [NASA]<br>
<br>
repeated thermal cycling: warm-cool-warm-cool. However, as the 
spacecraft was quickly receding from the Sun, warming had a limited 
effect and the temperature could only be raised by about 30 degrees 
Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) . That was not enough; Galileo had to 
fly on with an antenna that was only partly opened and therefore 
useless. If someone could have gone out to the spacecraft, the problem 
would have been fixed in no time. However, once an interplanetary probe 
is on its way, it is too late for even the simplest repair. Later the 
cause of the problem was traced back to Galileo's transportation to the 
launch site on a flatbed truck. Bouncing its way along thousands of 
kilometers of uneven, potholed freeways, pressure exerted on one side of
 the packed antenna probably caused the lubricant on a few rib pins to 
wear away. When Galileo reached the launch site in Florida, no one had 
checked the lubricant. With the HGA permanently stuck, Galileo had to 
carry out its mission using a low-gain antenna. This meant that the 
sending ofimages and other scientific information from its instruments 
was constrained to low data<br>
<br>

<br>
rates. Fortunately, by remotely programming Galilee's computer with new 
ways of compressing the data, and by being patient, most data 
nevertheless eventually found its way to the scientists on Earth. HGAs 
are sometimes creatively used for other purposes. The dish HGAs on 
NASA's orbiters Magellan and Cassini doubled as sunshades when the 
spacecraft were close to Venus and needed to be pointed at the Sun. 
Cassini's HGA also served as a protection shield against the thousands 
of micrometeoroid impacts it endured when, upon arrival at Saturn, it 
had to cross the planet's ring plane. It flew through a gap between the 
main rings, which consist of dust and ice particles. If we compare HGAs 
to optical telescopes, then low-gain antennas can be compared to the 
naked eye. LGAs cannot collect and focus as much data as HGAs, but 
because they have a much larger field ofview they don't need to be 
pointed very precisely. An LGA only allows low data rates, but it can be
 used before an unfoldable HGA is deployed, or when the spacecraft is 
for some reason unable to point its HGA in the direction of Earth . LGAs
 are small and light, so spacecraft usually carry at least two, one for 
redundancy in case the other does not work properly, and to ensure that 
at least one LGA is always able to have an unobstructed link with the 
Earth. Medium-gain antennas are a middle solution . MGAs provide more 
gain than LGAs and allow wider angles of pointing than HGAs . The 
Venusexploring Magellan spacecraft for instance carried a large 
cone-shaped MGA, which was used during some maneuvers when the HGA could
 not be pointed at Earth . The antennas on the outside are linked to the
 radio receivers and transmitters you can find inside the spacecraft. 
Modem receiving and transmitting equipment is usually combined into 
single units called "transponders." Transponders do not just receive and
 transmit on command, they also actively listen for and respond to 
signals coming from Earth. If a spacecraft can no longer transmit or 
receive radio signals, it will become utterly useless. Therefore 
satellites and interplanetary spacecraft usually carry at least two 
transponders - one for normal use, and one as a backup in case the other
 breaks down. Radio links with interplanetary spacecraft can be 
maintained over incredible distances. Until recently we could still talk
 with Pioneer 10, although it is now an incredible 12.3 billion 
kilometers (7.6 billion miles) from Earth. NASA's Pioneer 10 was 
launched On a powerful Atlas-Centaur rocket on March 2, 1972. As the 
fastest human-made object ever to leave the 69<br>
<br>
 Chapter 3 Earth, it became the first probe to reach Jupiter as it flew 
past the largest planet in the Solar System on December 3, 1973. The 
spacecraftwas the first to obtain close-up images ofJupiter, charted the
 gas giant's intense radiation belts, located the planet's magnetic 
field, and proved that Jupiter is predominantly a gas planet. Originally
 Pioneer 10 was designed only for the 21-month mission to Jupiter, but 
thanks to its rugged design and the continuous power supply by its RTG, 
Pioneer 10 lived on. It continued to explore the outer regions of the 
Solar System, studying energetic particles expelled by the Sun (the 
solar wind) and cosmic rays coming from outside the Solar System. In 
1983 it became the first human-made object to pass the orbit of Pluto, 
the most distant of the original nine planets (we now know there are 
more Pluto-like objects further out), and headed into the great dark 
unknown. The sturdy Pioneer continued to send valuable scientific data 
via its huge HGA until March 31,1997, when the RTG's output became 
insufficient to power its instruments. Nevertheless, the basic, weak 
''I'm here" signal from Pioneer's transmitter could still be received on
 Earth. At 82 times the distance of the Earth to the Sun, even traveling
 at the speed oflight, the space probe's radio signals took 11 hours 20 
minutes to reach the Earth. The attempts to receive Pioneer's signal had
 by then become part a new study of large-distance communication 
technology. The knowledge gained was used in support of NASA's future 
Interstellar Probe mission that is now on the drawing boards (see 
Chapter 9: "A Bright Future") . Finally, on January 22, 2003, Pioneer 
10's useful life came to an end when its last, extremely weak signal was
 received. More than 30 years after it had left our planet. "It was a 
workhorse that far exceeded its warranty, and I guess you could say we 
got our money's worth," commented Pioneer 10 Project Manager, Dr Larry 
Lasher, when Pioneer 10's long mission was finally over.<br>

STRUCTURES All the things you see sticking out ofa spacecraft, and all 
the things inside that you cannot see, need to be attached to a main 
structure. a skeleton that holds everything together. A spacecraft 
structure needs to be large enough to house and protect all the 
equipment and be strong enough to ensure that the spacecraftdoes not 70<br>

fall apart during launch and operation in space. It must also allow 
sufficient access for technicians to fit in all the equipment. Moreover,
 it needs to do all of this while being as light as possible. Modern 
spacecraft structures are usually made ofpanels consisting ofan aluminum
 honeycomb section sandwiched by aluminum sheets. These panels are very 
strong and stiff, but also very light and therefore ideal for spacecraft
 construction. The Russians liked to apply titanium as well, not only 
because it is strong and lightweight but is also able to handle much 
higher temperatures than aluminum. However, titanium is much more 
difficult to cast and machine; drill bits designed for piercing aluminum
 sheets simply break into pieces if you try to drive them through 
titanium, therefore special tools and manufacturing facilities are 
needed to build titanium structures. It is also very difficult to 
extract from mined titanium-containing minerals, and therefore, in 
general, titanium is rather expensive and not easy to obtain. However, 
during the Cold War, the Soviet Union was one of the few nations with 
rich titanium mines, so making spacecraft structures out of this 
precious metal was for them less of a problem than it was for other 
spacefaring nations. Because of their own very limited reserves of 
titanium, the USA even had to buy from the Soviets the large quantities 
of titanium needed for the super-secret SR-71 Blackbird plane. The 
Blackbird needed to be built 71<br>
<br>
 Chapter 3 from titanium because of the high aerothermodynamic 
temperatures it encountered when flying through the air at over three 
times the speed of sound. The Soviets never realized they were actually 
supplying the material for the construction of an airplane designed to 
spy on their own territory! Most Russian and US probes that have been 
sent into the extremely hot atmosphere of Venus (470 degrees Celsius or 
880 degrees Fahrenheit on the surface is normal) were built of titanium.
 The early probes that the Russians sent to Venus that were not built of
 titanium did not last very long. NASA's Galileo probe, which dived into
 the turbulent, hot and high-pressure atmosphere of giant Jupiter, also 
had a titanium structure. Advanced materials such as composites - some 
of which may be a mix of plastics, metals and glass fibers - are also 
used on spacecraft. Previously only employed when really necessary, 
growing experience with such novel structures now makes it possible to 
use composites such as CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics) more 
frequently. Often all kinds of beams, tubes, trusses and baffles need to
 be added to the main structure to ensure that all the various equipment
 can be mounted in and on the space probe. The driving requirements for 
the design of spacecraft structures are usually not set by the harsh 
space environment in which the probe will operate year after year, but 
by the launch phase that may take only a mere 10 minutes. During launch,
 the spacecraft is accelerated, shocked and shaken by the rocket it 
rides on. The launcher's rocket engines and the tremendous noise of the 
launch and aerodynamic buffeting during flight cause powerful and 
potentially damaging vibrations, like music that is too loud in a 
glassware shop. Moreover, the jettisoning of empty rocket stages, the 
ignition of the powerful rocket engines of subsequent stages and the 
final separation from the launcher's last stage cause sudden shocks that
 can really kick a spacecraft where it hurts . Probes that are meant to 
land on planets often also experience violent shocks on arrival. NASA's 
Pathfinder and MER landers depended on airbags for their final fall to 
the Martian surface. The airbags and the landers were designed to expect
 a maximum deceleration shock, equivalent to 40 times the lander's 
weight on Earth! Spacecraft structures therefore need to be carefully 
designed and tested. Fortunately, today's computer modeling technology 
has replaced much of the exhaustive trial-and-error testing and design 
sequences of the past. We can now efficiently optimize the structure for
 maximum strength and stiffness while keeping the mass as low as 
possible. 72<br>

 Anatomy of a Space Probe<br>
<br>
THERMAL CONTROL Most equipment on board a spacecraft operates best at 
temperatures between -5 and +40 degrees Celsius (20 and 120 degrees 
Fahrenheit). However, in Earth orbit the part ofthe spacecraftin full 
sunlight can reach temperatures around 120 degrees Celsius (250 degrees 
Fahrenheit), while the shadow side may get as cold as -160 degrees 
Celsius (-260 degrees Fahrenheit). The temperatures can even soar to 
much higher levels if the probe gets closer to the Sun, for instance if 
it flies to Mercury. In space, a spacecraft receives heat directly from 
the Sun, but also by energy reflected and radiated by the planet it may 
be orbiting (especially high if that planet is Venus). Moreover, a space
 probe generates heat itself through all its electrical equipment (and 
this can be a lot; just feel how much heat your television or CD player 
dissipates). To prevent the temperature from getting too high, a 
spacecraft must be able to dump its excess thermal energy. Likewise, 
when it gets too cold a space probe must be able to heat itself The 
simplest way to control the temperature is by the use of passive thermal
 control systems that do not require any additional power. Spacecraft 
are therefore commonly covered with various' metallic panels, thermal 
blankets, black or white areas and mirrors. These are all used to manage
 the heat that is emitted by the electrical equipment inside the 
spacecraft. If it gets too hot, the passive systems need to be able to 
let heat out. If it gets too cold, the passive systems need to keep more
 thermal energy inside. Like the skin of an animal, the passive 
coverings need to maintain the right thermal balance - to trap just 
enough heat to stay comfortably warm independent of the outside 
environment. It's something similar to a good sleeping bag that keeps 
you warm on a cold night and cool when it is hot. Solar reflectors 
reflect and emit infrared (heat) radiation; they prevent solar radiation
 from heating up the spacecraft surface, while letting excess internal 
heat escape. A good solar reflector is, for instance, a mirror or white 
paint (likewise, it is better to wear white clothes on a hot, sunny day 
instead of dark ones, and white cars stay cooler in the Sun than 
darkpainted cars). So-called flat reflectors like aluminum paint also 
block solar radiation from heating up the spacecraft,but contrary to 
solar reflectors they prevent internal heat from leaving the space probe
 body. They stop heat from being transported through the spacecraft's 
outer panels. Solar absorbers such as polished aluminum sheets soak up 
solar radiation and emit little energy, and thus help to keep a 
spacecraft warm. 73<br>
<br>
 Chapter 3 Flat absorbers like black paint absorb solar energy as well, 
but also emit internal energy easily; they make a surface heat up 
quickly but also cool down quickly (for example, wearing black clothes 
in the desert makes you overheat during the day and freeze at night) . 
Radiators are another type ofpassive system. Unlike the radiators of the
 central heating system in your house, spacecraft radiators are actually
 used to cool down a space probe . They absorb excess heat from inside 
the spacecraft and radiate it into space. Radiators are commonly used in
 combination with heatpipes, which are basically tubes containing a 
fluid. On the hot side - for instance, near an active electronics unit -
 the fluid in the pipe evaporates. Capillary pressure then makes it 
travel toward the radiator on the outside of the spacecraft where it 
condenses, giving off heat to the radiator that subsequently dumps it 
into space as infrared radiation. ry our radiator at home does the same,
 but in addition heats up air through conduction, which of course does 
not happen in the vacuum of space.) It's the spacecraft equivalent of 
sweating, with the difference that the fluid is not<br>

<br>
 Anatomy of a Space Probe lost but can be used again. The condensed 
fluid travels back to the hot zone to absorb heat and evaporate, over 
and over again, in a continuous flow. Heat pipes can thus be used to 
transport heat from inside the spacecraft to the outside. Even though 
the fluid is traveling back and forth, heatpipes work on thermal energy 
alone and do not need electricity. Yet another way of passive thermal 
control is the use of insulation . MLI, for Multi Layer Insulation, is 
the crumply, golden sheets you commonly see on the outside of satellites
 (see Figure 3.9). It consists of blankets built up from multiple 
separate sheets that alternate low-emitting surfaces (hardly emitting 
heat) with low-conductive barrier layers (hardly absorbing and 
transporting heat). Heat has a very difficult time getting through all 
these non-cooperating sheets, in both directions. Much like coffee or 
ice-water in a thermos flask, the warm items in the spacecraft stay 
warm, the cold items stay cold. Covering a spacecraftwith MLI is a real 
handicraft, as pieces have to be cut and folded in the right shape to 
fit the various surfaces, comers and protrusions. A spacecraft assembly 
room during MLI attachment somewhat resembles a children 's origami 
class. Sometimes a thermal control engineer can mix absorbers, 
reflectors, radiators and insulation in such a way that a good 
temperature balance can be reached within the spacecraft for its entire 
mission. An ideal space probe keeps itself warm by the heat its 
electrical equipment generates and some of the solar radiation it 
receives, while any excess heat is dumped into cold space by black 
surfaces and radiators. Usually, however , passive systems are not 
enough. Active thermal control systems such as electrical heaters and 
sometimes even coolant fluids pumped through the spacecraft are then 
needed to enforce the right thermal balance. Electric heaters work much 
like an electric blanket . Each heater consists of a simple wire that, 
because of its electrical resistance, generates heat when a current is 
passed through it. Thermostats similar to those used in your home switch
 the heaters on when the temperature drops below a certain minimum. 
However, just as in people and animals, heat generation or cooling costs
 energy - electric energy in the case of spacecraft, resulting in the 
need for larger and heavier solar arrays and batteries. Space probes 
landing on Mars or other planets often need to survive long, cold nights
 during which there is no light for the solar arrays to use to make 
electricity. To keep sufficiently warm without draining the rechargeable
 batteries, these probes can be equipped with Radio-isotope Heater Units
 (RHUs) . 75<br>

 Chapter 3 The RHUs on both NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and 
Opportunity, consist of2.7 grams of radioactive plutonium-238-dioxide, 
contained in a platinum-rhodium alloy cladding. All together an RHU 
weighs about 40 grams. Each of the eight units on board each rover emits
 about 1 watt of heat, simply by the radioactive decay of the material. 
They need no power or control system and can easily be placed where the 
spacecraft's other thermal control equipment has a hard time maintaining
 the temperature. Nevertheless they are not very popular, as apart from 
heat these little things also emit rather unhealthy levels of radiation.
 They can therefore only be inserted in the nearly complete 
spacecraftjust before launch, when no-one needs to be close to it any 
longer. All handling ofthe RHUs has to be done according to very 
stringent safety and security rules. Moreover, before launch it must be 
guaranteed that if the rocket fails the RHUs will either safely 
disappear into the depths of the ocean (where they are supposed to be 
harmless) or can be retrieved intact and removed from our environment. 
Each RHU of about the size of a camera film roll therefore consists 
mostly of shielding, to prevent the release of radioactive material in 
the environment in case ofa launch failure. The plutonium fuel pellet 
itself is only about the size of a small pencil eraser. RHUs can survive
 rocket explosions, fires, the intense heat of an accidental atmospheric
 re-entry and the impact ofhitting the ground from a high altitude. They
 have been tested in far worse conditions than they could ever encounter
 during a real launch, and have proven to be extremely rugged and 
reliable. However, another disadvantage is that RHUs cannot be switched 
off; they always produce heat, whether it is needed or not . That means 
that the spacecraft may actually require a cooling system to remove 
excess RHU heat during the "warm phases" of its mission. Thermal 
engineers and power subsystem designers always have to work closely 
together during the development of a new space probe . A higher 
electricity requirement results in a higher (solar) power generation, 
which means an increased internal thermal dissipation. This usually 
means trouble for the thermal engineer, who has to design a thermal 
subsystem that will remove the excess heat. However, when the spacecraft
 is in the shadow of a planet and the spacecraft cools off rapidly, the 
electrical power expert has to make sure that the batteries contain 
enough power to keep the inside of the probe comfortably warm .<br>

ATTITUDE CONTROL A spacecraft needs to control its own attitude while 
flying through space. This is necessary to point the scientific 
instruments to the target, the solar arrays to the Sun, the antennas to 
the Earth, and to keep the heatdissipating radiators in the shadow. 
Moreover, before firing a rocket thruster to do orbit maneuvers, the 
nozzle has to be pointed in the right direction. There are two main ways
 to control the attitude of a space probe. The simplest is to make the 
spacecraftspin. Like a spinning top, the gyroscopic effect will keep the
 rotational axis of the probe in the same direction, as long as the 
craft is in balance. The spin can be started by a mechanism on the 
launcher or mother spacecraftjust before the probe or capsule is 
separated from it, or by small rocket thrusters on board the probe 
itself Once started, a mechanical force or rocket thrust is no longer 
necessary. As there is no friction with any atmosphere in space, a 
rightly balanced space probe that is set to spin will rotate at the same
 speed almost indefinitely (in reality its spin will be slowly disrupted
 by movem ents of equipment inside the spacecraft and the minute drag of
 the upper atmosphere while in Earth orbit) . Small pulses of rocket 
thrusts are only needed occasionally to point the spacecraft in a 
different direction. Spin stabilization is very efficient, as you hardly
 need any power or rocket thrust to maintain the spacecraft's attitude. 
Because of this simplicity and efficiency, most early satellites and 
interplanetary probes used spin stabilization. The downside of spinning 
is that all the onboard equipment is also rotating, making it difficult 
to point cameras, antennas and solar arrays in a certain direction. Some
 therefore have scientific instruments installed on complicated de-spun 
platforms that are not rotating with the rest of the probe, so that 
cameras and other sensors can aim constantly at their targets. Moreover,
 for a stable rotation a spinning spacecraft needs to be masssymmetrical
 in the plane in which it is spinning, otherwise it would wobble . 
Spinning spacecraft are therefore usually cylindrical, with a 
horizontally placed antenna dish bolted on top. To ensure that the solar
 cells are always in sunlight, they need to be mounted all around on a 
spinning spacecraft. This means that you need a relatively high number 
of solar cells, because while spinning only about one-third are 
sufficiently aimed toward the Sun at any time. If you need a lot of 
power, you may have to make your probe very large to fit all the 
necessary solar cells. 77<br>

All of this puts severe limitations on the design of spinning probes, 
although the method is still applied when the advantages outweigh the 
disadvantages. A good example of the modern use of spinning space probes
 is ESA's Cluster II mission, which involves four identical, drum-shaped
 spacecraft. (The original Cluster mission was lost with the failed 
launch of the first Ariane 5 rocket described in the previous chapter, 
but new spacecraft were built and launched, and the project rose like a 
phoenix from its ashes.) The Cluster probes fly in formation in a very 
elongated Earth orbit through space, to study the flow of electric 
particles expelled by the Sun (the solar wind). The four 2.9-meter 
(9.5-foot) diameter satellites roam the area where 78<br>
<br>
 Anatomy of a Space Probe<br>
<br>
the solar wind crashes into the Earth's magnetic field, some 60,000 
kilometers (37,000 miles) out on the sunny side ofour planet. The 
Earth's magnetic field, the same that makes a compass turn north, acts 
as a shield to prevent the particles from reaching our atmosphere. It is
 much like the way a magnet can be used to repel other magnets. We are 
lucky for this protection, as the electric particles can severely upset 
electrical equipment; sometimes a solar storm is strong enough to 
puncture the Earth's magnetic defense, producing beautiful auroras where
 the particles clash with the atmosphere, but also triggering power 
blackouts. Moreover, when the flow of charged particles hits the upper 
atmosphere, it heats it up and may thereby have an effect on our weather
 and climate. Furthermore, the atmosphere expands when it warms up, 
increasing the aerodynamic drag on low orbiting satellites and making 
them fall back to Earth much earlier than planned. For scientific 
instruments that need to measure magnetic fields and particle streams, 
bolting them on spinning satellites like those of Cluster II results in a
 very beneficial sweeping motion. This ensures measurements of local 
averages rather than measurements at single, perhaps abnormal, points. 
The Cluster satellites have electric sensors whirling on SO-meterlong 
(160-foot-Iong) wires and magnetometers on deployable booms to cover a 
wide area. An instrument on a spinning spacecraft also has a 360-degree 
field of view. That may mean that you need only one camera while, on a 
similar but non-spinning probe, you may need two or more. The use offour
 satellites, as on Cluster, makes it possible to tell whether a certain 
change in the measurements is caused by the passing oftime or by the 
movement of the spacecraft through space. With fewer spacecraft this 
would have been almost impossible to determine. Capsules with 
instruments or landers on board that need to descend through planetary 
atmospheres are usually also spin-stabilized. With the right design, a 
spinning entry probe will always maintain its right attitude, even while
 crashing through the Martian atmosphere at tens ofkilometers or miles 
per second. This is extremely important, as the thick heatshield that 
protects the probe against the superheated atmospheric gasses must be 
kept in front, and the parachute pack must be at the back. If the probe 
started to tumble, it could easily burn up, or its parachutes may wrap 
themselves around it. However, most modern spacecraft are three-axis 
stabilized, which means that they do not spin but their attitude is 
actively controlled around all three possible rotational axes. This 
offers a lot more freedom in the design of the spacecraft and makes it 
possible to point the equipment in 79<br>
<br>
 Chapter 3<br>

the most optimal directions. Three-axis-stabilized spacecraft are 
usually box shaped and, because they don't need to bother with spinning 
stability, can be very asymmetrical. Nearly all three-axis-stabilized 
space probes have a reaction control subsystem consisting of a series of
 small thrusters distributed over the spacecraft. Firing a thruster on 
the left side and another in the opposite direction on the right side 
causes a rotation, as long as the thrust is not pointed exactly through 
the probe's center of mass. With six small thrusters a simple spacecraft
 can be nudged around all of its three axes. Another method for 
three-axis stabilization is the use of electrically powered reaction 
wheels (also called control momentum wheels). These often fairly heavy, 
solid metal wheels with fixed axes are used to rotate the spacecraft in 
different directions. If a wheel is set in motion with an electric 
motor, not only will the wheel start to rotate, but the space probe 
itself will also begin to spin in the opposite direction. While the 
reaction wheel is rotating on the spacecraft, the spacecraft is rotating
 with respect to the wheel. This is another manifestation of Newton's 
"action == reaction" principle that is also behind the working of rocket
 motors .<br>

is a typical example of a three-axis stabilized spacecraft. [ESAJ<br>
<br>
In reality the wheels are always and continuously turning in one 
direction only, and the rotating force is obtained by acceleration and 
deceleration. Accelerating a wheel has the same effect as spinning it up
 from standstill. Deceleration is equivalent to spinning it in the 
opposite direction. Since a spacecraft has three orthogonal axes around 
which it can rotate (one for left-right or "yaw" rotations, one for 
up-down or "pitch" rotations and one for "roll" rotations), it can in 
principle be controlled by three of these reaction wheels (although 
there are smart ways to do it with only two). To make the spacecraft 
rotate in one direction, you spin up the proper wheel in the oppo site 
direction. To rotate the vehicle back, you slow down the wheel. A fourth
 wheel is usually included as a spare, in case one of the other three 
breaks down. 81<br>
<br>
 Chapter 3 If a wheel is spun more often in one direction than in the 
other, after a while it will turn at its maximum velocity. Reaction 
wheels can typically reach speeds of 6,000 revolutions per minute! The 
wheel then has to be slowed down. Without any compensation, decelerating
 the wheel would make the spacecraft rotate, but by using opposite 
thrust from the reaction control system this can be avoided. Such an 
action is called "momentum desaturation" or "momentum unloading." Once 
the wheel regains a reasonable velocity, the reaction control system can
 be disengaged and the wheel can be again used for rotation control. 
Although most spacecraft use thrusters for these momentum desaturation 
maneuvers, some spacecraft contain sensitive optical equipment that can 
be contaminated by the exhaust of the rocket thrusters. The Hubble Space
 Telescope, for instance, uses magnetic torquers instead of thrusters. 
Magnetic torquers are essentially long electromagnets that align 
themselves with respect to an external magnetic field when electricity 
is flowing through them. The effect is similar to that of a compass 
needle lining itself up to the direction ofthe Earth's magnetic field. 
As you need a relatively strong magnetic field of a planet to use 
magnetic torquers, they are mostly used on Earth-orbiting satellites and
 seldom on interplanetary probes. A strong benefit is that, unlike 
thrusters, they only require electrical power. That means you can do 
momentum desaturation maneuvers without consuming any of the precious 
propellant. Three-axis-controlled spacecraft can point antennas and 
instruments continuously in any given direction, without having to 
de-spin them. However, while a probe orbits a planet, it requires a 
slow, continuous rotation to keep its cameras pointed at the surface. It
 will also need to change its attitude to keep its antenna pointed to 
the Earth. If thrusters are used for routine stabilization and attitude 
change maneuvers, this will require a relatively high amount of 
propellant. Moreover, it means that the spacecraft is always slowly 
rocking back and forth, because there are limits to how precisely a 
thruster can be fired. Often you will overshoot and need another impulse
 to compensate, which in turn is bound to be less precise than required 
and therefore needs compensation itself This can complicate 
long-duration observations with optical cameras that have to be pointed 
in precisely the same direction for extended times. The use of reaction 
wheels results in a much steadier spacecraft, but they can be rather 
heavy, suffer from relatively high failure rates, and have limited 
mechanical lifetimes that need to be taken into account. The choice for 
the type of stabilization the spacecraft designers make<br>
<br>
82<br>
<br>
 Anatomy of a Space Probe<br>
<br>
depends on what the space probe is supposed to do, how accurate its 
measurements have to be, and how large and heavy the design can be 
allowed to become . That is why each method of stabilization, spin and 
three-axis, with rocket thrusters, reaction wheels or otherwise, is 
still being used in modern space probes and satellites today. 
Irrespective of how it is stabilized, if a spacecraft is to point itself
 in the right directions it needs to know what those directions are. On 
Earth, navigators on board ships and airplanes used to look at the 
stars, the position of the Sun and the direction of a compass needle to 
find out where they were going. Modern space probes employ similar 
methods, and carry a range of sensors that tell them where they are and 
what their attitude is. "Sun sensors" indicate to a spacecraft the 
direction of the Sun. They come in two basic varieties: coarse and fine.
 "Coarse sun sensors" can only tell if the Sun is in their field of 
view, and are thus used only for very general direction determination. 
They usually consist of a simple solar cell that only gives off 
electricity if the Sun shines on it. Coarse sun sensors may, for 
instance, be useful to help to point the solar arrays at the Sun and 
keep onboard electricity flowing in case ofa serious attitude control 
failure. "Fine sun sensors" measure the Sun's direction - and therefore 
the space probe's attitude with respect to it - much more accurately 
than coarse sun sensors. A simple version may consist ofa solar cell and
 a device that measures the amount of electricity it generates. The more
 directly the Sun shines on it, the higher the voltage. Others employ 
constructions that cast shadow patterns on solar cells. The location and
 shape of the shadows then indicate the precise direction of the Sun. 
"Horizon sensors" are used to find a planet's horizon from an orbiting 
spacecraft. They usually consist of an infrared detector that measures 
the abrupt change in infrared radiation when it sweeps from deep space 
onto the planet, or vice versa. However, they are only good for giving 
very rough directions, and usually depend on the radiation from carbon 
dioxide in a planet's atmosphere. Most of them would not work on a moon 
without an atmosphere, and they would also easilybe confused by the 
radiation from a large mother planet behind a moon. "Star trackers" are 
optical sensors that can be pointed at a single star. By tracking how 
this star is moving in the sensor's field ofview, a star tracker can 
tell the spacecraft the direction in which it is moving or rotating. By 
keeping a star tracker trained at a certain star, the side of the space 
probe on which it is located is always pointed in the same direction. 
"Star mappers" are similar to star trackers, but follow more than one 83<br>
<br>
 Chapter 3<br>
<br>
FIGURE 3.13 Star trackers like these tell a spacecraft its attitude with respect tothe stars. [EADS Space]<br>
<br>
star in their field of view. By remembering the positions of several 
stars with respect to each other, their electronics can determine the 
orientation of the spacecraft in all three dimensions. Using a star 
tracker is like finding a certain constellation on a dark night, or a 
star in that constellation, to determine the direction you are looking. 
For instance, the North Pole Star, Polaris, always tells you where to 
find the north. Using a star mapper is like using the shape of a 
constellation to determine not only your direction, but also your own 
relative position; if you see Orion or the Big Dipper upside down, you 
must be standing on your head (or you somehow have ended up on the other
 hemisphere). Star trackers and mappers can normally only be used on 
three-axisstabilized spacecraft or on de-spun platforms of spinning 
spacecraft. On a spinning spacecraft you usually need "star scanners," 
which keep track of stars quickly flying through their field ofview to 
determine the spacecraft's attitude with the help of a programmed star 
catalog. Magnetometers measure the direction and sometimes the strength 
of a local magnetic field. They are relatively simple devices, but you 
need a relatively strong magnetic field for them to work. Moreover, 
planetary 84<br>
<br>
 Anatomy of a Space Probe<br>
<br>
magnetic fields usually have all kinds of fluctuations and 
abnormalities. These have to be mapped in detail for the magnetometers 
to give anything more than a very crude sense of direction. 
Magnetometers as attitude control sensors are therefore mostly used on 
Earth-orbiting satellites, but as scientific instruments for measuring 
magnetic fields they are widely employed on interplanetary spacecraft 
(we shall discuss this in a later chapter). Gyroscopes do not indicate 
actual directions with respect to the outside world, but accurately tell
 a spacecraft the directions and velocities of its own rotations. 
Traditional gyroscopes are like spinning tops that always point in the 
same direction, measuring how the rest of the spacecraft is rotating 
around them. Modern Ring Laser Gyros use a laser beam that is split and 
projected into two ring-shaped cavities, pointed in different 
directions. Because the laser generates a very coherent beam oflight, 
both of the beams will have the same, very specific frequency. When the 
spacecraftand the gyro are rotating, the wavelengths and thus 
frequencies of the normally identical laser beams diverge a little with 
respect to each other. This Doppler effect is similar to the different 
sounds a train makes when it is coming toward you and when it is moving 
away. When it rushes past, you hear the frequency of its sound changing 
from high to low. When the wave patterns of the two beams are combined 
by two opposing mirrors arranged to reflect precisely against each 
other, they result in a certain interference pattern . (For example, if 
you throw two stones into a pond, the resulting waves will meet. At 
certain places the result will be higher waves; at other places the 
"valleys" and "hills" of the waves will cancel each other out.) Due to 
the Doppler effect, the interference pattern of the two beams at rest is
 different from when they are rotating, and in a Ring Laser Gyro this 
principle is used to measure how rapidly a spacecraft is turning. 
Starting with a known attitude, and by keeping track of the spacecraft's
 rotations using gyroscopes, you can still get a good idea ofits new 
attitude after some movements. It's something similar to standing in a 
room in the direction of the door, and have someone turn you around with
 your eyes closed. As long as the movements are not too fast or too 
many, you will still be able to tell where the door is at any time. 
Gyroscopes are often combined with accelerometers in so-called Inertial 
Measurement Units (IMUs). The accelerometers measure the rate of change 
in velocity over a specific period of time, and can therefore tell the 
spacecraft when it has fired its rocket engines for the sufficient 85<br>
<br>
 Chapter 3 length of time. The gyroscopes measure how fast the 
spacecraft is turning and can thus be used to control rotation speeds. 
Gyroscopes are also useful to estimate the spacecraft's orientation for 
short periods, when for example the spacecraft is turning too quickly 
for the star trackers to work properly . 1MU s usually have three 
gyroscopes and three accelerometers - one . combination of both for each
 spacecraft axis. For accurate attitude determination and navigation - 
and sufficient amounts of redundancy in case equipment fails - most 
space probes combine the various types of sensors described here. It's 
no wonder that the design of the attitude control subsystem can easily 
becoming very complicated.<br>
<br>
PROPULSION When putting an interplanetary spacecraft on our imaginary 
dissecting table, we had better make sure that its potentially dangerous
 rocket propulsion system is inoperative. Interplanetary spacecraft 
usually have one or more relatively large rocket motors, of a size you 
normally do not see on Earth satellites. They need these to make 
trajectory adjustments , brake to get into an orbit around another 
planet, and change their orbit altitude and inclination (the angle with 
respect to the planet's equator) .<br>

The operation of chemical rocket engines has been explained earlier in 
this book (see "Rockets and Satellites" on page 4). As on launch 
vehicles, most rocket propulsion subsystems on board spacecraft consist 
of tanks with propellants, rocket engines, and pipes with various valves
 to transport the propellants from the tanks to the engines. The 
propellants are either pumped into the engines or forced into them by 
high-pressure gas from another tank. Some propulsion subsystems use a 
single type of propellant, called a "monopropellant," which can bum on 
its own with the use of a chemical catalyst like platinum or iridium (a 
catalyst is a chemical substance that helps a chemical reaction but is 
not actually part of it; it's a sort of molecular helping hand). 
Hydrazine is a commonly used monopropellant. More powerful spacecraft 
engines use bipropellants, with an oxidizer (typically nitrogen 
tetroxide) and a fuel (usually monomethyl hydrazine) stored in separate 
tanks. These are burned together in the engine, usually igniting 
automatically when mixed (which is very handy, but it also means that 
they have to be kept absolutely separate until needed). Sometimes 
boosters with solid propellants are used. These are basically cylinders 
with a nozzle, filled with a solid body ofa fast-burning substance 
(called the propellant "grain"), much like the rockets fired at New 
Year's Eve. Boosters are powerful and relatively simple, lacking all the
 complicated plumbing needed for liquid propellants, but they can only 
be used once. After ignition, the motor just bums till the propellant 
has been exhausted. It cannot be throttled up or down, it cannot be 
stopped, and, like a match, it cannot be tested before actual use. An 
additional liquid propellant subsystem is therefore usually needed for 
the more gentle, repetitive boosts. Solid propellant motors are used to 
kick spacecraft into or out ofan orbit - for instance, to speed them 
from Earth orbit into an interplanetary trajectory. The firing of these 
motors stands high on the list of most nervewracking moments in a 
spacecraft's operational life. If they don't ignite, space probes get 
stuck in Earth orbit and will never reach the Moon or another planet. If
 they do, solid propellant boosters sometimes violently explode; then 
your expensive spacecraft is not only stuck, but also in pieces. NASA's 
"Contour" comet explorer recently suffered this awful fate. If you want 
to use a solid propellant rocket motor later in the flight - for 
instance, to launch something back from Mars - you have to make sure 
that the long exposure to extreme temperatures in space has not affected
 the propellant. The grain may have been cracked, or its chemical 
properties may have changed so that the motor will give a lower thrust .

Electric propulsion subsystems such as that on SMART 1 (see the "Proving
 Technology" section on page 33) generally include similar equipment as 
conventional liquid propulsion subsystems, except that the tanks can be 
much smaller and the actual engines look very different. The reaction 
control subsystem of a spacecraft is also usually considered to be a 
part of the propulsion subsystem, often feeding off the same tanks as 
the main rocket engine. Reaction control thrusters work in a similar way
 as the large main rocket motors, but produce much lower thrusts. They 
are used to rotate the spacecraft around its own axes, and are thus a 
means of controlling its attitude. Simple subsystems on some small 
spacecraft use cold gas thrusters. Just like a party balloon, these 
thrusters give a push simply by opening a valve and letting out a 
pressurized gas (usually nitrogen) without the need for any combustion. 
These are relatively cheap, but are not very powerful. Small electric 
propulsion thrusters, usually fed with Xenon gas, can also be used for 
attitude control, but their thrust is even weaker than that of cold gas 
thrusters. Nevertheless, their high propellant efficiency makes them 
very interesting for long-duration missions that only need gentle 
maneuvers with little attitude control thrust. In such cases they can 
save a lot of propellant tank volume. The small thrusters for attitude 
control are sometimes also used for orbit maneuvering. In such cases the
 thrusters are used in pairs on both sides of the spacecraft, to ensure 
that they do not induce rotations but change the spacecraft's velocity 
in a certain direction.<br>
<br>
DATA HANDLING Traditionally, humans act as the brain of such complicated
 moving machines as cars, jet fighters, cranes, tanks, submarines, 
cruise ships and helicopters. Unmanned military observation airplanes 
flying over dangerous areas are often remotely controlled by people on 
the ground. However, this can only work ifthe operator is on board the 
vehicle or is at least close enough to control the system remotely 
without long delays. Space probes are often too far away to be directly 
controlled by radio as the signals may take hours to travel from the 
control station on Earth to the spacecraft and back. Moreover, modem 
spacecraft are often far too complex and things happen too quickly for a
 human to be in direct, real-time control. That is why most space probes
 really need to be robotic. 89<br>
<br>
 Chapter 3 Today's space probes can have several computers on board, but
 one main computer is usually responsible for the overall management of 
the activities; the brain of the spacecraft. This computer maintains the
 timing and the sequence ofwhat needs to be done, interprets commands 
from Earth, and collects, processes, and formats the telemetry data that
 needs to be sent to Earth. It may also interpret the signals it 
receives from the star trackers and other sensors and activate reaction 
control thrusters or reaction wheels to correct the attitude, although 
that is often the job of a separate attitude control computer. In the 
old days, programs were often "hard-wired"; the software was a fixed, 
permanent part of the computer and could not be changed after launch. 
Nowadays software can be improved and adapted to new situations, and be 
uploaded to the spacecraft by radio to overwrite previous programs. 
Space probes are sometimes even launched before all their onboard 
software is ready. They start out with only the basic operating 
instructions needed for the first part of the mission, while the rest is
 being developed for uploading later. Modem spacecraft computers are 
based on commercial chips that are also used in home computers, but are 
significantly modified to ensure that they survive the much higher 
radiation levels in space. The computer of NASA's latest Mars explorer, 
the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, for instance, employs a new generation 
ofspace-qualifiedprocessors, based on the 133-MHz PowerPC processor. The
 computer you have at home is probably much faster and working at 
Gigahertz speeds. However, your PC would not last very long above the 
Earth's atmosphere, with all the radiation and extreme temperatures 
there. Spacecraft working far from Earth and doing difficult work have 
to be especially autonomous. For example, radio signals from the Cassini
 probe , currently in orbit around Saturn, take one and half hours to 
reach our ground stations. A command from us to the spacecraft then 
takes the same period oftime to reach Cassini. If the spacecraft had no 
autonomy, manual operation with such three-hour delays would be 
extremely difficult and make everything work in slow motion! Moreover, 
viewed from Earth, interplanetary spacecraft may at certain times orbit 
behind the Sun for over a week, or for a shorter time move behind a 
planet. When that happens communication is impossible, and the 
spacecraft is required to survive on its own for the duration of that 
phase. Crucial orbital maneuvers involving rocket firings often take 
place while spacecraft are out of communication, so a certain level of 
autonomy is absolutely necessary. 90<br>
<br>
 Anatomy of a Space Probe The spacecraft computer also controls the 
scientific instruments and stores the data they collect. If there are 
lots of scientific instruments to handle, a separate Payload computer is
 sometimes installed. To store data from the instruments, modem space 
probes use Solid State Recorders. The one on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
 (MRO) has a total capacity of 160 Gigabits, which means it can hold the
 data equivalent of 40,000 pop songs. Instead ofmusic, science data is 
stored until it can be transmitted to Earth, and then overwritten with 
new data. A capacity of 160 Gigabits may seem like a lot, but it may 
require up to 28 Gigabits to store a single image taken with MRO's 
HiRISE instrument system! Solid State Recorders are so called because, 
unlike tape recorders and hard disk drives, they have no moving parts. 
Instead they are based on several hundreds of memory chips for storing 
digital data. W ithout moving elements, they are much more reliable and 
less likely to break down during many years of continuous usage. The 
first interplanetary spacecraft to use Solid State Recorders instead of 
tape recorders was the Saturn orbiter Cassini, which reached the ringed 
planet onJuly 2004. The previous large interplanetary NASA mission, the 
Galileo orbiter that was sent to Jupiter, had to fly with old-fashioned 
tape recorders, and they caused a lot of problems. In the past, all the 
measurements of all the onboard scientific instruments were recorded and
 sent to Earth via radio. Separating the important information from the 
redundant data and useless noise was done on Earth, with large and heavy
 computers requiring lots of calculation time. However, improvements in 
spacecraft technology are often accompanied with increases in the amount
 of data that needs to be stored and transmitted. The latest instruments
 often produce far too much data to send over the communications link to
 Earth; it would take too long and require excessively large 
transmitters that would use too much electrical power. Fortunately, also
 in this respect, spacecraft are getting smarter. Modem computer 
technology allows much of the raw data to be sorted out on board the 
spacecraft, and only the much reduced, partly analyzed data needs to be 
sent back to Earth for further examination. The onboard computer relies 
on complicated software programs to run everything on board. The 
software aims the solar arrays and antennas, directs temperature 
regulation equipment, prepares data for transmitting to Earth and puts 
scientific instruments on and off. The onboard software also tells the 
spacecraft what to do when something goes wrong - for instance, if it 
loses track of its attitude or its critical equipment is malfunctioning.
 It then makes the probe go into "safe-mode," and the robot puts itself 
into a stable situation to await 91<br>
<br>
 Chapter 3 orders from Earth. It's like a child who has lost his or her 
parents in a busy supermarket, just waiting around at the same place 
until one of them shows up. In safe-mode a spacecraft only operates at a
 minimum, not doing much other than directing its solar arrays at the 
Sun and its main antenna at the Earth to send housekeeping telemetry 
(data on the functioning of its subsystems) back to its operators. 
Safe-mode is basically a sort of standby function on the spacecraft. If 
something goes seriously wrong with the attitude control system, the 
probe may completely lose its sense of direction. It then no longer 
knows where the Sun is, where the Earth is, or what its attitude is. In 
this case it goes into "survival mode," operating at the truly bare 
minimum. Typically the spacecraft will then send out simple distress 
signals (the child in the supermarket example is now also screaming) and
 use its coarse Sun sensors to roughly find out where the Sun is. It 
will also start to rotate in the hope that the Earth will eventually 
move into view of the antennas so that the ground stations can receive 
the calls for help. The ground controllers can then tell the probe were 
to point its antennas, and start to receive more detailed telemetry data
 to help to find solutions to the problems on board. As space robots get
 more and more autonomous, they are increasingly capable of handling 
difficulties themselves, without intervention by ground control support.
 Often they can even predict that equipment is about to malfunction - 
for instance, if the temperature ofa reaction wheel is getting too high 
due to increased friction. They can basically "feel," just as we would 
put down heavy shopping bags when our arms started to ache, to prevent 
us from pulling a muscle. An interesting example ofan important piece of
 onboard software is the Command-Loss Timer. Every time the spacecraft 
is in radio contact with Earth this timer is reset to a certain value, 
for instance a week. When the spacecraft loses contact with its 
controllers on the ground, the timer starts to count down. If it reaches
 zero - meaning that for a week it hasn't heard anything from control - 
it starts to operate following the pre-programmed assumption that its 
receiver or something else is broken Gust as you might check whether 
your phone is still working if your mother hasn't called for some time).
 Other software then commands the spacecraft to switch to backup 
equipment such as the redundant receiver, to see ifit can get a signal 
that way. The spacecraft may also start to sweep the sky with its 
antennas to try to find the radio beam from Earth , just in case there 
is something wrong with its attitude determination and control 
subsystem.<br>

 Anatomy of a Space Probe<br>
<br>
Once the probe is in contact with Earth once more, the ground control 
teams can figure out what happened. Sometimes they can correct the 
problem by sending updated software to the spacecraft and remotely 
installing it on its computer. They can also permanently deactivate 
faulty equipment and tell the spacecraft never to use that faulty part 
again.<br>
<br>
MECHANISMS The mechanisms on a spacecraft have the same function as the 
joints in our bodies; they are used to rotate, deploy, eject, open and 
close things. Designers always attempt to keep the number of mechanisms 
in a spacecraft as low as possible, because they have a relatively high 
chance of failure and usually a breakdown is critical to the mission. 
For instance, ifa mechanism that has to release a folded solar array 
does not work, the spacecraft will not be able to generate enough 
electricity or even, perhaps, no power at all. Galilee's stuck umbrella 
antenna mentioned before is another example of how a problem with one 
relatively simple mechanism can severely upset mission plans. Developing
 mechanisms for space is pretty hard, mainly because of the high 
temperature changes they have to endure and the need to maximize their 
reliability. Lubrications used in mechanisms on Earth, such as oil or 
grease, evaporate or freeze in space. Moreover, ifa space probe 
mechanism gets stuck in space there is no one around to give it a kick 
and get it working again. Mechanisms for the deployment ofsolar arrays, 
antennas etc. are usually activated soon after launch, to give the space
 environment as little chance as possible to have adverse effects. 
Deployment mechanisms are normally needed only once; after they have 
done their work it is no longer important whether their lubrication 
dries up or their wheels freeze and stick. For these one-shot mechanisms
 spacecraft engineers often employ pyrotechnical devices - small 
explosives set offby a small spike of electric current. These are small,
 simple, cheap and relatively reliable, but they can be used only once. 
As the explosives can be dangerous to people, much care for safety has 
to be taken during testing and integration with the spacecraft on the 
ground. Pyro devices are used for various tasks: to separate a 
spacecraft from its launch vehicle, to permanently deploy antenna booms;
 to release instrument covers, to permanently open or close valves in 
propellant<br>
<br>
93<br>
<br>
 Chapter 3 lines; to jettison heatshields; and to deploy parachutes on 
lander systems. NASA's Mars Pathfinder mission with its Sojourner rover 
depended on the operation of 42 pyro device activations during entry 
into the Martian atmosphere, the descent and finally the landing. First 
the l l-meter (36foot) parachute had to be shot out of the lander. Then 
the front heatshield was pyrotechnically ejected, followed by the 
separation of the lander from the protective backshell. Just before 
hitting the ground, the airbags were released by pyrotechnically cutting
 the ties on their wrapping during the flight to Mars. These airbags 
were subsequently inflated with gas generated by burning small amounts 
of solid propellant in three separate gas generators. Solid propellant 
rocket engines were fired to slow the lander down in the final seconds 
before landing, and the lander was finally cut free from the parachute 
with a pyro device. Like a giant beach ball Pathfinder then bounced over
 the surface of Mars 15 times for almost 1 kilometer (0.6 mile), rising 
as high as 15 meters (50 feet). More recently, each of the larger Mars 
Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, fired no less than 126 pyro 
devices during the same mission phases. Other mechanisms need to work 
properly and continuously during the entire mission, such as 
antenna-pointing mechanisms and the Solar Array Drive Mechanisms that 
keep the solar arrays aimed at the Sun. These mechanisms require special
 attention and are therefore rather expensive, in the order of half a 
million dollars each. Special mechanisms are those on planetary rovers, 
such as the electric motors driving the wheels. Their lifetime is not 
only measured in absolute time, but also in revolutions - that is, the 
number of times the wheels have gone round. There is a lot ofwear and 
tear by Moon or Mars dust that gets into delicate mechanisms and grinds 
carefully polished surfaces each time a wheel makes a tum. Given enough 
time, the wheel mechanisms will be so badly damaged that the internal 
friction becomes higher than the engines can overcome, at which moment 
the rover will be stuck. The lifetimes of planetary orbiters are 
measured in years, but the birthdays ofa rover on the surface of Mars 
are celebrated a month at a time. On the other hand, knowing what may 
happen to spacecraftequipment used in harsh environments may inspire 
engineers to make their mechanisms so sturdy that they actually perform 
much better and longer than strictly required. The NASA rovers Spirit 
and Opportunity were, for instance, designed to last three months on the
 surface of Mars, but at the time of writing they are still going strong
 over two years after landing.<br>

THE KIDNAP OF LUNA 1 As we are curious about how a modem interplanetary 
spacecraft works, in our imagination we have put one on an operating 
table and investigated it inside and out. However, in a Spaaiflight 
magazine article called "Those magnificent spooks and their spying 
machines," author Dwayne A. Day describes how the CIA once did such a 
thing for real! In 1959 the Cold War was running hot in space. The 
Soviets were launching a series of ever-larger satellites on their big 
launchers, and the USA was scrambling to keep up. In January of that 
year the Soviets even managed to passwithin 6,000 kilometers (3,700 
miles) of the lunar surface with their Luna 1 spacecraft, although they 
lost contact with it after 62 hours. America felt it was seriously 
behind in space technology and really wanted to get a good look at its 
rival's spacecraft. At the time, both superpowers were trying hard to 
convince the rest of the world that their social economic systems were 
the best. The Soviets and Americans were especially struggling for 
influence in the Third World countries, where many governments had not 
yet made a choice which of the two they would prefer to act as their big
 brother. Space achievements were valuable propaganda material for 
showcasing technological superiority, and a real production model ofthe 
Luna 1 probe was displayed at the sable and mink pelt exhibition in 
Mexico City. The spacecraft came complete with its rocket insertion 
stage and covering launcher payload fairing, in which three windows had 
been cut to enable the public to view the inside of the small lunar 
probe . After the show, the spacecraft and accompanying displays were to
 be carried by truck to a railroad station for further transport to 
Veracruz by train. The Soviets had placed an inspector at the station to
 check and log the arrival of each truck. However, they had not given 
him any means of communication with the fairground from which the trucks
 were departing. Moreover, the trucks drove without any escort. The CIA 
saw an amazing opportunity and its agents arranged for the Luna 
spacecraft to be on the last outbound truck of the day. They stopped it 
at a turnoff and drove it to a salvage yard they had rented. CIA experts
 spent the evening and most of the night thoroughly inspecting Luna 1 
and gaining valuable knowledge about the secrets of Soviet space 
technology. In particular, they learned which Soviet companies were the 
producers of the spacecraft and its components, and the kind ofguidance 
system that Luna 1 used. In addition, they found out that this 
particular model was the fifth of its type that the Soviets had 
constructed. 95<br>
<br>
 Chapter 3 About an hour after the experts left, a CIA driver drove the 
truck to a pre-arranged point to meet the original driver, who then took
 over the vehicle and continued his journey to the train station. The 
Soviet inspector arrived shortly afterwards, logged the crate with the 
spacecraft, and had it loaded on a railroad flatcar. The train left with
 all the crates, and the Soviets apparently had no suspicion of what had
 happened between that morning and the evening before. Sometimes 
spacecraft engineering can be as glamorous as aJames Bond mOVIe.<br>

ow, clear your mind from the mess we created by dissecting an imaginary 
spacecraft, and let's have a look how it really workshow spacecraft are 
actually built and tested. THE SPACECRAFT GARAGE<br>
<br>
Spacecraft Prime Contractors, the companies responsible for the overall 
design and construction of spacecraft, assemble them from the loose 
pieces of equipment described in the previous chapter. This equipment 
has been designed, built and tested separately, often by other companies
 acting as subcontractors in the project . Like a garage full of car 
wheels, doors , windows, bumpers and engine parts, each of the equipment
 units has been individually checked for quality and should fit 
perfectly into the final product. However, the big challenge remaining 
is to put it all together into a working machine; good parts do not 
necessarily make a good car. 97<br>
<br>

equipment units and the layout of the spacecraft structure. [ESAJ<br>
<br>
How their equipment connects with the rest of the satellite is a special
 concern to equipment designers. All the equipment built by all the 
different companies has to match perfectly into a single spacecraft. 
Often this cannot be tested until all the equipment is ready and the 
assembly of the spacecraft has actually been started. Building 
interplanetary space probes requires great care, as the equipment from 
which a spacecraft is assembled is very expensive, sometimes fragile and
 often unique . A falling tool can easily damage the lens of a 
multimillion-dollar telescope instrument and delay a mission by months. 
In 1968, a technician working on an astronomical observatory satellite 
named " Copernicus" tripped over a piece of scrap lumber while helping 
to carry the main mirror for the spacecraft's telescope. The accident 
destroyed<br>

<br>
 Building and Testing<br>
<br>
the million-dollar mirror and seriously threatened the spacecraft's 
production schedule, because it took nine months to build a new one. In 
2004 an almost finished NOAA meteorological satellite fell off the 
ground support trolley to which it was supposed to be securely bolted. 
The spacecraft smacked onto the hard floor, resulting in millions of 
dollars ofdamage. The bolts were missing: someone forgot to put them 
back after a test, and another person forgot to check if they were 
really there before moving the trolley with the spacecraft on it. If 
parts of a spacecraft break, you cannot go back to the shop to get a new
 one in time for the launch , and nor can you make some quick repairs. 
Taking a spacecraft apart, manufacturing replacement parts, reassembling
 and retesting can take many months. Moreover, undiscovered assembly 
mistakes cannot be solved after launch, so great care is taken over even
 the simplest action. Typically one engineer is working on something 
while another is checking everything the other person does, all the time
 maintaining a list of all the actions performed. Building a spacecraft 
is therefore a slow and meticulous process.<br>

KEEP IT CLEAN Spacecraft are built and tested in so-called "cleanrooms" 
that are cleaner than a normal hospital operating theatre. A cleanroom 
is an area where the air is filtered to contain only a very limited 
amount of dust particles. Dust can blind sensitive optical instruments 
and sensors. It can also mess up the measurements of equipment that 
determines the composition of dust particles in comets or on other 
planets. It is essential to make sure that what is being measured is 
really space dust, and not Earth dust that has been caught inside the 
instrument! A cleanroom can never be completely dust-free, but it can be
 filtered to various high levels of cleanliness. Most spacecraft require
 so-called Class 100,000 cleanrooms for construction and testing, 
meaning that there must be fewer than 100,000 dust particles larger than
 0.5 micrometer (1.6 millionth of a foot) per cubic foot (about 27 
liters) of air. To give you an idea ofhow clean this is: the room in 
which you are reading this right now probably contains several million 
dust particles per liter of air! The Beagle 2 Marslander was even 
constructed in a Class 100 facility - an area with less than 100 dust 
particles over 0.5 micrometer per cubic foot. A major source of dust in a
 cleanroom are the people working in it. That is why, before entering a 
cleanroom, you have to put on a dust-free "bunny suit": a long lab coat,
 gloves and elasticized covers over your head and shoes. Then you walk 
across a sticky floor-mat to remove dirt from your soles. Cleanrooms of 
Class 10,000 and better also require people to wear surgical facemasks. 
Humidity and temperature also need to be controlled. Humidity must be 
kept fairly low, typicallywithin a range of 40 to 55 per cent, i.e. the 
air should contain no less than 40 per cent and no more than 55 per cent
 of the maximum amount ofwater vapor it can carry. The temperature 
inside a cleanroom is usually about 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees 
Fahrenheit). The need for cleanrooms goes together with the increased 
sensitivity and therefore fragility of spacecraft hardware. The 
Russians, with their more ruggedly designed equipment, are known to 
assemble their spacecraft in factory-like facilities. Discarded tools 
and rusting pieces of scrap are lying around in their assembly halls and
 launch preparation buildings. Nevertheless, their spacecraft generally 
work well. Small satellites built by universities and radio amateurs 
often do not follow the conventional cleanroom approaches either. 
Apparently, cleanrooms of a high class are not always needed, but to 
have a mission worth hundreds of millions of dollars fail because of 
some dirt on a critical detector is an unacceptable risk. 100<br>

PLANETARY PROTECTION Assembling equipment and spacecraft becomes even 
harder if "Planetary Protection" measures have to be taken. These are 
implemented to avoid the pollution of planets with Earth microbes, and 
to avoid the Earth from being contaminated by microbes from space. 
Although this sounds like something hypothetical from a science fiction 
movie (think of the Man in Black "protecting the Earth from the scum 
ofthe Universe," the sick alien invaders of War of the Worlds, or The 
Andromeda Strain) it is in fact a very serious business. Most places in 
the Solar System are regarded as completely dead. Life as we know it 
could never survive the heat and harsh radiation on Mercury, or the lack
 of water and air on the Moon. However, some unknown microbes or simple 
plants may still exist on Mars or live deep under the surface of some 
moons ofJupiter. William Randolph Hearst, the famous American publisher,
 once sent a telegram to a leading astronomer asking "Is there life on 
Mars? Please cable 1,000 words." The astronomer replied with " N obody 
knows," repeated 500 times. We must make sure that our space probes that
 visit those places do not accidentally contaminate the environments of 
these possible indigenous lifeforms. Some especially tough Earthly 
microbes might be able to survive on Mars. Multiplying rapidly, they 
could contaminate the planet and forever change the environments in 
which genuine Martian microbes may be living. An analogy often used is 
that of the rabbits that early colonists brought to Australia. Some 
escaped from the farms, and without sufficient numbers ofnatural enemies
 they multiplied rapidly and soon turned into a plague. Another historic
 example is that of the rats that commonly lived on the old sailing 
ships. When these ships visited deserted islands to look for water and 
food, the rats sometimes managed to leave the vessel. Unable to protect 
themselves from the suddenly appearing strangers, flora and fauna on 
many formerly pristine islands was totally ruined. The death of many 
Native Americans due to diseases brought to America by European 
explorers and conquerors is another lesson from history. The problem 
could also happen the other way around: the Earth environment could 
potentially be contaminated by Martian microbes carried on board future 
spacecraft bringing back samples of the Martian soil and atmosphere. 
When the Apollo 11 crew returned from their historic voyage to the Moon,
 they were immediately put inside a hermetically sealed caravan. 102<br>
<br>
 Building and Testing<br>
<br>
FIGURE 4.4 The Apollo 11 astronauts greeted by president Nixon, whilebeing locked up in their quarantine caravan. [NASA]<br>
<br>
They had to stay there for three days, until the doctors were reasonably
 certain they had not been infected by possible "Moon germs." After 
later Apollo lunar landings confirmed that nothing lived on the Moon, 
these somewhat unfriendly reception procedures were no longer applied to
 Moon missions. The moonrocks the moonwalkers brought with them were 
handled and examined in a specially built facility, to avoid moon dust 
or lunar microbes getting into the Earth's environment. These lunar 
samples are still stored in this place, to keep them absolutely clean 
and pristine. However, no one fears a possible "lunar plague" nowadays. 
In contrast, material from Mars is still considered to be potentially 
dangerous, and when future spacecraft eventually bring some to Earth it 
103<br>

FIGURE 4.5 Moonrocks like thisone collected by thecrew ifApollo 15 were

<br>
will have to be treated with the utmost care. Samples scooped from the 
surface or drilled up from below it must be hermetically sealed. No 
surface of the spacecraft that has been exposed to the Martian ground or
 atmosphere will be allowed to come in contact with the Earth 
environment upon return. This results in very complicated packaging 
mechanisms and difficult sample transfers between the spacecraft 
launched from Mars and the separate spacecraft flying back to Earth. 
Moreover, we must be absolutely sure that when the container with Mars 
samples returns to Earth it will in no circumstances bum up during 
re-entry or crack open when landing. As parachutes can tail, the return 
capsule cannot rely on them and has to be designed in such a way that it
 can survive re-entry and a high-velocity impact without any active 
stabilization or braking mechanisms. The NASA and ESA designs for such 
capsules pack the sample containers in thick layers of foamy material 
inside a thick self-stabilizing heatshield. The capsules will not have 
parachutes, because they must be 104<br>
<br>
 Building and Testing able to land without them. Future Martian rocks 
brought to Earth will arrive with a bang! Cleaning spacecraft equipment 
and keeping it sterile during assembly and testing is very difficult, 
slows down the spacecraft construction and is rather expensive. It 
requires especially clean facilities, assembly procedures that minimize 
the amount the spacecraft needs to be touched, and sterilization 
procedures with dry heat, gamma radiation, gas plasma or disinfecting 
wipes. The fully assembled spacecraft needs to be sealed inside an 
airtight "bioshield" and is sometimes heated to 120 degrees Celsius (250
 degrees Fahrenheit) for final sterilization. Putting the spacecraft in 
an oven kills most microbes, but can also destroy some materials 
normally used in the spacecraft, like certain plastics and electronics. 
Specially developed hightemperature equipment may be needed, thus 
increasing costs and complexity even more . Working on spacecraft with 
severe Planetary Protection requirements is a very slow and difficult 
process. Engineers have to wear chirurgical outfits while working on the
 spacecraft, and their gloves make it difficult to manipulate small 
parts. The assembly room for the Beagle 2 Marslander even had a large 
glass window behind which a Planetary Protection expert continually 
watched the assembly technicians work. He kept a list of how many times a
 part of the lander was touched, ordering cleaning measures when a 
certain limit was reached. He also checked whether the engineers were 
not accidentally breathing on the spacecraft through their surgical 
masks. If they put their hands in their sides too long (a habit of 
spacecraft assemblers because it prevents them from accidentally 
touching things), skin cells could be rubbed through their coats onto 
their gloves, and they had therefore to wash their hands before 
continuing. Apart from seriously slowing down the assembly work, the 
strict supervision and continual cleaning actions also put a severe 
psychological load on the engineers. Planetary Protection measures are 
the cause of many heated debates between those who think it is 
absolutely necessary, and those who regard it as a waste of time and 
money. Some are convinced that the likeliness of a microbe from Earth 
surviving on Mars is extremely small. Moreover, they argue that possible
 life on Mars would in any case be so different from that on our planet 
that one could never influence or infect the other. Dr Zubrin, famous 
promoter of the Mars Direct plan for crewed missions to the red planet, 
likens it to the chance of our being infected by a sick tree, or vice 
versa. 105<br>
<br>
 Chapter 4 Before Planetary Protection became a serious consideration, 
the Russians landed or crashed various spacecraft on Mars that were not 
sterilized in any way. Microbes from Earth have thus already arrived on 
the red planet. If these somehow felt at home in their new environment, 
they could have multiplied exponentially and it will already be too late
 for any measures to prevent them from taking over the planet. Apart 
from that, impacts of large asteroids and comets have kicked rocks from 
Earth into space, and some must have eventually reached Mars. Likewise, 
we have found meteorites on Earth that, we are sure, originated from 
Mars, because the chemical composition of the rock and the tiny gas 
bubbles within is extremely similar to the composition of the rocks and 
atmosphere our robotic landers have found on Mars. Microbes may have 
survived the trip inside these rocks, as research on the meteorites from
 Mars seems to point out that the inside of those rocks never reached 
temperatures high enough for complete sterilization. Bacteria and spores
 may thus have been traveling between Earth and Mars for hundreds of 
millions ofyears. If so, both planets have long since been infected with
 each other's microscopic life forms and our drastic Planetary 
Protection measures would seem rather pointless. In 1984 scientists 
found a Martian meteorite (numbered ALH84001) on the Allan Hills ice 
field in Antarctica. The stone was apparently blasted into space some 16
 million years ago, but the material inside even appeared to be about 
4.6 billion years old - around the time when the Solar System was formed
 . Much later, investigators found what appeared to be a fossil of a 
tiny microbe inside the meteorite. They also detected substances that 
looked like products of microbial metabolism. In August 1996 NASA staged
 a big media event to announce this spectacular discovery. The story 
ofthe alien fossil was big news all over the world, and the topic of 
many articles and television programs. However, since then new research 
has cast considerable doubt on the possible alien microfossil. The 
debate about whether it really once was a microbe or the shape is just 
the result ofinorganic chemical processes still rages. Also, the 
meteorite could have been invaded by Earth microbes after landing at the
 South Pole, which could explain the presence of organic molecules 
inside the rock. ("Organic" in this case simply means that the molecules
 contain carbon; all known forms of life are based on molecules with 
chains of carbon atoms, but organic molecules are not necessarily 
created by life.) Meteorite ALH84001 does not seem to offer any 
conclusive evidence about possible Martian life and the chances of 
microbes hitch-hiking to other planets. 106<br>

FIGURE 4.6 This worm-shaped object, less than 1j100th the width of a 
human hair, was found inside a meteorite that came from Mars. It might

<br>
The general consensus among scientists is that we should not take 
chances with the potentially disastrous effects of contamination with 
strange, new microbes. They have made very strict, internationally 
agreed rules about which Planetary Protection measures are applicable to
 what type of missions. For now, spacecraft developers willjust have to 
live with them. Apart from contamination prevention, spacecraft looking 
for life on other planets such as Mars need to be decontaminated for 
another reason. If the lander were to carry a collection of microbes 
from Earth, its instruments could detect these instead of Martian 
microbes. With a "dirty" spacecraft you can never be sure that what you 
have detected is really from the planet you are exploring. Sterilization
 measures for Marslanders looking for life are therefore more severe 
than those for spacecraft merely investigating the geology of the 
planet. The rover on board the future ESA ExoMars spacecraftwill drill 
below the surface and deposit samples into an automatic, onboard 
minilaboratory. Inside, the material will be warmed up to see what kind 
of gasses come out. Some of these gasses may indicate the presence of 
107<br>
<br>
 Chapter 4 microbes in the soil. The interior of this little laboratory 
must be absolutely pristine before the Mars soil is inserted. 
Fortunately, the oven used to warm up the samples can also be cranked up
 to heat itself to sterilizing high temperatures. It is in fact a 
self-cleaning instrument.<br>
<br>
SHAKE, RATTLE 'N' ROLL Because interplanetary robotic missions are 
expensive and challenging, we want to ensure that our spacecraft can 
handle the harsh experiences of launch and flying through space before 
we send them on their way. Just as ships are checked to be seaworthy, 
spacecraft are tested to be spaceworthy. Testing of the complete 
spacecraft is very important, because although all the equipment 
individually may be functioning correctly, this does not guarantee that 
the whole spacecraft works as planned when everything has been put 
together. Often the interactions between otherwise perfectly working 
parts is where things go wrong. NASA's Mars Polar Lander, launched in 
1999, was designed to softly land on the south pole ofMars and 
investigate the terrain there. However,<br>
<br>
FIGURE 4.7 The Mars Polar Lander, which was unfortunately lost just 
before landing due to a sojtiuare error combined with insufficient 
testing. [NASA] 108<br>
<br>
 Building and Testing while descending to the surface on the thrust of 
its rocket engines something went wrong and once more a Mars probe 
disappeared without a trace. (The long list of failed Mars missions has 
space engineers jokingly theorize about a "Great Galactic Ghoul," a 
monster ferociously devouring space probes on their way to the red 
planet.) Investigations to find out what had happened finally concluded 
that faulty software in combination with inadequate testing led to the 
loss of the spacecraft. The three landing legs of Mars Polar Lander 
contain small microswitches that are triggered when the legs touch the 
surface, signaling the landing engines to cease firing. Post-accident 
tests showed that when the retracted legs are unfolded during the 
descent, the shock of their deployment accidentally triggers these 
microswitches. This makes the onboard computer believe that it has 
already reached the Martian surface and thus needs to shut off the 
engines. However, when the legs are unfolded the lander is actually 
still far above the ground. Without the rocket engines, the uncontrolled
 Mars Polar Lander fell down rapidly and crashed. A couple of lines of 
code could have commanded the computer to ignore the landing signal 
during leg deployment, but it was never programmed into the lander's 
software. The bug did not show up during testing, because the 
microswitches and the deployment of the legs were tested separately. A 
combined test would have shown the problem, but the very tight budget 
did not allow for that. The failure forced NASA to rethink its then 
paradigm "Faster, Better, Cheaper" approach, with its very short 
development phases and minimal budgets. The agency decided to allocate 
more money to the management and testing activities for its future space
 probes. Apart from the actual spacecraft to be launched, special 
full-scale development models of the space probe are often built and 
tested during the development phase. Typical ones are Structure Models, 
Structure/ Thermal Models, Engineering Models, and Qualification Models.
 A Structure Model is used to test the spacecraft structure, mostly to 
see whether it can withstand a rocket launch. For missions such as 
Messenger and BepiColombo the Structure Model is enhanced into a 
Strucrure/ Thermal Model, to test how the spacecraft will endure the 
severe temperatures near Mercury. An Engineering Model looks a lot like 
the actual spacecraft, but is built at a lower quality and without 
backup equipment. It is mostly used to test the electrical functioning 
of the spacecraft. A Qualification Model is built to the same quality 
standards as the 109<br>
<br>
 Chapter 4 eventual spacecraft Flight Model, but is tested more severely
 than the actual flying probe and does not necessarily include all the 
backup equipment. Once the boundaries of the design's resilience have 
been verified, the Flight Model that will actually be launched only 
needs to be tested to the less demanding Acceptance Test levels. Often a
 Qualification Model is not needed, and the Qualification Tests are done
 on the finally built spacecraft. This is then called a Proto Flight 
Model. Important cost savings can also be made by using the Structure 
Model as the basis of the Flight or Proto Flight Model, but only if it 
has not been damaged during testing of course. Special facilities have 
been developed to simulate a launch and the vacuum and the harsh thermal
 and radiation environments beyond Earth's atmosphere. In these test 
centers we can check whether our spacecraft and its development models 
behave as we designed them to do. If anything does not meet our 
expectations, we can still correct the design ofthe space probe to make 
sure that we do not experience the same problems during the real flight.<br>
<br>
Shaken, not stirred Some of the first test facilities to which a 
spacecraft is subjected are the "shakers ," mechanical vibration 
platforms that simulate the onslaught of a launch . Spacecraft are 
shaken from left to right, back and forth, and up and down; one movement
 at a time in most test facilities, but modem systems can shake space 
probes realistically in all directions simultaneously. To avoid the 
shakers shaking the building as well as the spacecraft, they are built 
on their own independent and separatefoundations, and suspended on air 
springs. A vibration test normally lasts only a few minute s, during 
which you can hardly see the spacecraft move. Nevertheless, the forces 
involved are severe and quite capable of destroying a badly designed 
spacecraft; optical lenses can be shattered in an instant, and metal 
panels and housings can be cracked ifthe vibrations are not sufficiently
 dampened and loads are not equally distributed over the spacecraft's 
structure. Designers must make sure that the frequencies at which a 
spacecraft "likes" to move, the so-called "natural frequencies" or 
"Eigenfrequencies," are sufficiently far removed from the frequencies at
 which the launcher makes it vibrate. It's similar to jumping on a 
trampoline, where you can jump higher and higher if you find the right 
rhythm. Spacecraft have to be designed in such a way that their natural 
vibration rhythm is not the same as the rhythm of the launcher, 
otherwise the spacecraft may break up. 110<br>

 Building and Testing<br>
<br>

Acoustic Facility, where the acoustic violence of a rocket launch can be

<br>
Vibration tests can be so punishing that engineers sometimes prefer to 
build and test a Structural Model of the spacecraft before committing 
the real machine to the ordeal. If the model breaks, at least the final 
spacecraft can still be redesigned and the cost impact of the failure is
 limited. Related to the shaker tests are the noise vibration tests, 
during which engineers measure whether a spacecraft can withstand the 
terrible noise of a rocket launch . This is tested by blasting it with 
sound from huge speakers inside a special chamber. The Large European 
Acoustic Facility of ESA's ESTEC Test Centre is a room 11 meters (36 
feet) wide, 9 meters (30 feet) deep and nearly 17 meter (56 feet) high 
(see Figure 4.8). It has solid concrete walls of 0.5 meter (1.6 feet) 
thick to contain the sound . The noise level inside the payload fairing 
on top ofa rocket can rise to a deafening 150 decibels or more, 
comparable to several Boeing 747s taking 111<br>
<br>
 Chapter 4 off at a distance of 30 meters (100 feet). The lowest 
frequencies in the noise of a launch are the main problem, as they can 
make a spacecraft vibrate, just as the bass from a large loudspeaker can
 make your breastbone resonate.<br>
<br>
Canned space Temperatures on the outside of a spacecraft in orbit near 
Earth can vary from some 120 degrees Celsius (250 degrees Fahrenheit) to
 -160 degrees Celsius (-260 degrees Fahrenheit) . Add to that the vacuum
 and radiation conditions, and it is clear that space is a very harsh 
environment. To test how well a new space probe can handle these 
conditions, sophisticated space simulators are used. The big ones are 
large enough to contain an entire spacecraft; ESA's Large Space 
Simulator has a main chamber that is 15 meters (49 feet) high and 10 
meters (33 feet) in diameter . By pumping liquid nitrogen through its 
walls, this test chamber can be cooled to -196 degrees Celsius (-321 
degrees Fahrenheit). This not only helps to simulate the coldness 
ofspace, but also to achieve a very high level of vacuum; once most of 
the air has been pumped out, the remaining molecules freeze to the walls
 of the chamber and are removed from the test environment. The Space 
Simulator can also simulate the radiation from the Sun with the help of 
19 Xenon lamps of 25 kW each (an IMAX theater uses just one of these 
lamps to project movies onto its giant screen). The lamps simulate the 
composition and the unfiltered intensity of sunlight above the 
atmosphere, and can raise a spacecraft's temperature to higher than the 
boiling point of water. Inside the facility the satellite can be mounted
 on a special carrier mechanism that can rotate to simulate the movement
 of the spacecraft in orbit. The only factor a space simulator facility 
cannot replicate is weightlessness.<br>
<br>
Antenna testing Satellites and interplanetary space probes rely on 
antennas to communicate with the ground. These are very critical to the 
success of a mission and thus need to be tested. Antenna test rooms are 
covered with radio frequency radiation absorbing pyramids to avoid 
reflections of the radio signals, as there are no walls in space. The 
foamy material also absorbs sound very well, like 112<br>
<br>
 Building and Testing snow; people's voices have a complete lack of echo
 inside such a room, resulting in rather eerie, surreal sounds. To avoid
 interference from television or outside radio signals, the walls of the
 chamber also form a steel Faraday cage that prevents any 
electromagnetic radiation from entering. Wave fronts of radio signals 
emitted from an antenna close by are curved, like the waves in a little 
pond when you throw a stone into it. However, wave fronts from 
spacecraft in deep space arrive at the Earth as straight, parallel 
lines, like waves from the open sea arriving at the beach. Radio test 
chambers for spacecraft therefore include special reflector panels. 
These bounce the curved radio wave fronts from the nearby antenna and 
straighten them. In this way we can simulate radio signals coming from a
 great distance within a relatively small test chamber.<br>
<br>
Special cases Some spacecraft require special tests that are not 
standard. For instance, they may have electromagnetic instruments on 
board that are sensitive to interference from other electrical equipment
 on the space probe (something similar to the way a magnet can influence
 another magnet). In this case, the amount of possible disturbances 
needs to be checked in an electromagnetic compatibility test room. To 
make sure that the electrical systems work even in difficult 
circumstances - for instance, under the influence of the strong 
electromagnetic radiation near Jupiter - the satellite can furthermore 
be placed in a powerful electromagnetic field that can cause electrical 
failures. Very different tests are required for landers and rovers. To 
test the parachutes and their deployment, test models of lander probes 
are sometimes dropped over deserted test areas from aircraft or 
high-altitude balloons. Airbags such as those used on NASA's Pathfinder 
and MER landers need to be tested by dropping them on simulated 
planetary surfaces. The lower gravity on Mars, 38 percent of that on 
Earth, can be simulated by letting the probe and its airbags fall on an 
inclined panel with simulated Martian rocks and dust. The force of the 
angled impact is then comparable to that of a fall on a horizontal 
surface on Mars. Rovers are also tested on simulated surfaces. Engineers
 have them driven over rocks and through sand and dust with a similar 
consistency to lunar or Martian soil. These tests can even be useful 
when the rover is already moving around at its destination: when one of 
the MER Marsrovers was about to descend inside a crater, a test model 
was driven 113<br>
<br>
 Chapter 4 through a similar situation in the laboratory on Earth to 
make sure that its cousin on Mars wouldn't slide down the relatively 
steep crater wall. More tests were needed later, when the MER 
Opportunity became stuck in a soft-sand dune . To investigate the kind 
of material in which the rover was trapped, and the best way to 
extricate it, engineers, scientists, outside advisers, and even the 
project manager at NASA's JPL center mixed sand and powder, dug holes 
and built dunes . The blend of sandy and powdery materials used needed 
to match the way the Martian soil had worked itself into spaces between 
the cleats on Opportunity's wheels. "We tested with one mix of 
materials, decided it wasn't quite nasty enough, made the mix nastier 
and tested again. We tested getting the rover stuck and then unstuck in a
 bunch of different configurations, some of which we think were worse 
than the one we've gotten ourselves into on Mars," one of the scientists
 involved explained. Eventually the team found a way to free the rover, 
and managed to steer it to more solid ground. The tests were not only 
crucial for Opportunity's escape, but also for finding out why it got 
stuck in the first place. This resulted in new rover driving operational
 rules to prevent similar problems in the future.<br>
<br>
Breaking the software Software testing is a very special activity. A 
small mistake, such as a missing point or a single wrong number hidden 
in ten thousand lines of programming code, could be disastrous to an 
otherwise perfectly designed spacecraft. Space agencies therefore often 
commission an independent company one that has not been involved in the 
development of the software - to try to find errors. Software validation
 engineers creatively launch all kinds of possible scenarios to the 
software to see if it would be able to save the spacecraft out of any 
situation. The problem with this kind of testing is that when the 
verification experts say the software is fine, you cannot be sure that 
they really tried every possible scenario. If an error is found , you 
know someone has been looking for it. But how would you know if someone 
skipped a critical test to be home in time for dinner, and forgot to 
perform it the next day? A way to deal with this is to offer an 
incentive , like a financial bonus if the spacecraft's software operates
 without major problems for a year or so. This encourages the software 
testers to really dig deep and find any errors lurking inside the 
complex programming.<br>

F the mission is not intended to test new technology or merely plant a 
nation's flag on another planet , the scientific instruments on board a 
space probe are its most important equipment. They are the "payload" of 
the spacecraft. The payload is the reason for the probe 's existence; 
the rest of the spacecraft is only there to take the science instruments
 to their target, to give them power, to keep them at the right 
temperature, to aim them correctly and to send their data back to Earth.
 We use spacecraft instruments in the same way that we use, for example,
 microscopes in a laboratory on Earth, except that we have to operate 
them remotely as they are hundreds of millions of kilometers away. The 
instruments are what gives us new knowledge about the Solar System, the 
Universe and thus ultimately about ourselves. And it is a lot. The 
Voyager 2 mission for instance returned five trillion bits of data from 
its visits ofJupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. That's enough to 
encode over 6,000 sets of the Encyclopedia Britannica!<br>

<br>
THE MORE WE LEARN, THE MORE WE DON'T KNOW All interplanetary spacecraft 
to date have carried some sort of scientific payload; there is still no 
other compelling reason to venture into the Solar System except science 
and curiosity. The first probes carried simple instruments, as even a 
fuzzy picture in black and white of the farside (back) of the Moon was 
quite an achievement in the early days of spaceflight. As science and 
technology progressed, instruments and space probes became more 
sophisticated. The more we learned about the Moon or another planet, the
 more new questions were raised, and this is still so today. Often 
scientists end up with more questions at the end of a space mission than
 they had before its launch . Every interplanetary mission spawns the 
need for another mission to answer these new questions. Normally it 
requires more sophisticated instruments than before to find the answers.
 Take the Moon, for example. In the early days we just wanted to have a 
better look at its surface. In particular, the side that is always 
turned away from us (the farside) begged to be explored, and simple 
cameras were all it took to do this. The photos the first Moon probes 
made of the lunar farside were a surprise. They revealed far fewer of 
the large, dark, flat areas, called "seas" or "mare regions" than are 
found on the lunar nearside (the face of the Moon that is turned toward 
Earth) . A new question was raised: Why is there such a difference 
between the two halves of the Moon? Moreover, the pictures showed that 
the lunar surface is covered with craters ofall sizes, but could not 
reveal whether they had a volcanic origin or were created by the impact 
of meteorites . More detailed pictures by better cameras made during 
subsequent missions also showed that the whole lunar surface is covered 
with dust. How deep was this dust? If we were to send astronauts there, 
would they sink down in meters ofpowder? The only way to find out was to
 land something on the lunar surface. This was much more complicated 
than just putting a probe in orbit around the Moon, because a lander had
 to be controlled very precisely to make a soft landing at the right 
location . Robotic landers showed that the dust was only a couple of 
centimeters thick and would cause no danger to a human landing. Mter a 
historic effort of human imagination, determination and technology, the 
Apollo astronauts were sent to the Moon and brought back rocks that 
showed that the craters were caused by impacts, not by volcanism. 116<br>
<br>
 Instruments of Science<br>
<br>
However, even though astronauts walked on its surface, the Moon has 
still largely remained a mystery. Instruments left by the Apollo 
astronauts measured seismic activity, which leaves us to wonder whether 
the Moon is really geologically as dead as we used to think. Also, it is
 still not really clear what the Moon looks like under the surface. 
Robotic probes showed that on the poles of the Moon there are deep 
craters, the bottom of which may never see any sunlight. In the cold 
shadow deep down, water-ice brought by impacting comets could have 
gathered and may still be there. New, sophisticated probes with modem 
instruments able to detect water-ice will be needed to test this theory.
 We have come a long way in exploring the Moon, and we know a great deal
 more about it than 60 years ago. However, the number ofquestions we 
have about it now is a lot higher than the number we started with at the
 end of the 1950s. Moreover, they are much more complicated to answer. 
We discovered that the Moon is a much more interesting place than we 
thought, begging for further investigation with more, improved space 
probes and instruments. Not surprisingly, this process of new answers 
leading to new questions and the constant need for another mission has 
been consistent for every place we have investigated in the Solar 
System. The more we explore, the more we learn how much we don't know 
about the Universe. The best way to limit the number ofunknowns about 
the Solar System would actually be to stop interplanetary spaceflight at
 once! However, that would stop the proliferation ofquestions, but not 
our curiosity of course. It would also be very boring. Payload 
instruments are often rather complex, and of many different types. They 
are therefore usually developed and built by specialized scientific 
institutes, laboratories and universities. The scientists responsible 
for developing an instrument are usually also those who will harvest and
 analyze the data it sends back. Only when these experts have crunched 
the numbers, separated reality from wishful thinking and resolved the 
mysteries can the discoveries be described in ways that non-experts 
understand. This process can take months, or even years, from when the 
original data is collected by the instruments on board the spacecraft. 
Mission by mission, scientists are building an ever more complete 
description of the Solar System and the Universe . Most interplanetary 
spacecraft have several large and smaller instruments on board. From all
 the scientific proposals, a good suite of instruments is defined by the
 responsible space agency; contracts are placed and each instrument gets
 developed and built by a specific team. In the end all the separate 
instruments are integrated into the spacecraft. 117<br>
<br>
 Chapter 5 However, sometimes the payload consists of only one large and
 very complex instrument, for instance a large space telescope that 
completely defines the spacecraft layout. The spacecraft may actually 
need to be built around the instrument, and in that case the instrument 
and the rest of the spacecraft are often developed in parallel by a 
large industry, with scientists providing support rather than building 
the instrument themselves. In almost any space project there are 
conflicts between the scientists trying to perfect their instruments, 
and the spacecraft designers trying to produce the overall most 
efficient and cost-effective mission design. As already described, the 
design of a new space mission is always a compromise between conflicting
 requirements.<br>
<br>
LET'S GET PHYSICAL To understand how instruments on board spacecraft are
 used, we need to have a look at the physics behind them . Most 
spacecraft instruments, especially those on board planetary orbiters, 
detect electromagnetic radiation in one way or another. Electromagnetic 
radiation, including visible light, can be described as consisting of 
waves of electric and magnetic energy (hence the term 
"electromagnetic"). These waves vibrate up and down at right angles to 
the direction ofmotion ofthe radiation (such as going from the Sun to 
the Earth) - see Figure 5.1. When we look for a certain radio station we
 try to tune the receiver to pick up signals of a certain wavelength. 
The wavelength for radio signals, and any other type of electromagnetic 
radiation, is the distance between any two corresponding points on 
successive waves (for instance, from one peak to the next). Visible 
light, the light we can see, ranges in wavelength from about 400 up to 
700 billionths of a meter. That's the scale of microbes. There is, 
however, much more that is invisible to us; the full electromagnetic 
spectrum ranges from gamma-rays with wavelengths in the range of one 
billionth of a meter (on the scale of atomic nuclei), to radio waves 
with wavelengths of centimeters and meters. They are all forms of 
electromagnetic radiation, which differ from each other in the size 
ofwavelength. (See Figure 1.5 on page 14.) The frequency ofthe radiation
 is directly related to the wavelength, and is the number of waves 
passing by within one second. It is expressed in Hertz (Hz); 10 Hz means
 10 waves per second. As electromagnetic 118<br>

FIGURE 5.1 Light can be described asa wave traveling along the direction<br>

<br>
radiation moves with the speed of light, the longer the wavelength, the 
longer it takes a wave to pass by, and thus the lower the frequency . 
And VIce versa. The frequency of visible light, what we call "color," 
ranges from 430 trillion Hz (red light) to 750 trillion Hz (violet 
light). Again, the full range of frequencies extends far beyond, from 
less than 1,000 Hz for very low frequency radio waves, to over 3 billion
 times a billion Hz for gamma-rays. Light waves are waves of energy, and
 the amount of their energy is proportionally related to the frequency 
(and thus inversely proportional to the wavelength); the higher the 
frequency, the greater the amount of energy. Gamma-rays thus have the 
highest frequency and therefore the most energy, which is why they are 
very dangerous for your health. Radio waves have very low energies; they
 can be generated by a tiny transmitter with a small battery inside a 
car-key, for example. When talking about energy, electromagnetic 
radiation is often described as consisting of streams of particles or 
energy packets called "photons" instead of waves. For centuries, the 
"wave theory" and "particle theory" have been in competition with each 
other for explaining various phenomena associated with light and other 
forms of radiation. Nowadays physicists believe that electromagnetic 
radiation can behave both as a particle and as a wave, but that either 
description is only a simplification of something very complex. Some 
phenomena can best be 119<br>
<br>
 Chapter 5 described by waves, others by assuming the existence 
ofphotons. Neither waves nor particles form the absolute truth; both are
 just ways to mathematically model and understand light. The "white" 
light we see from the Sun does not have a single color, or wavelength or
 frequency or energy, but is made up of many colors. The things we see 
around us have color because different surfaces reflect light in 
different ways; some surfaces reflect a lot of blue but no red, others 
reflect mostly green . This is because the surfaces absorb light of 
certain wavelengths or frequencies. The absorbed colors are removed from
 the white light mix, and only the colors left over will come bouncing 
back. Ifyou go into a dark room and shine a flashlight on a red ball, it
 appears red because all the colors ofthe white light except red get 
absorbed by it. If you put a green filter in front of the light and 
shine on the ball again, this time the object will look black. This is 
because the ball absorbs the green light as before, but now there is no 
red light to reflect (the filter absorbs the red, and all the other 
colors except green , when the light goes through it). With a 
spectroscope - for instance, a glass prism - you can split sunlight into
 its constituent colors, like raindrops creating a rainbow. You will 
then see that sunlight covers the full visible spectrum, from red to 
violet. With a good spectroscope, you can also identify peculiar dark 
and especially bright lines. The dark ones are called absorption lines. 
The atoms ofthe Sun's outer atmosphere absorb radiation emitted by the 
layers below at a series of very specific wavelengths. When this 
radiation is reemitted, it is re-radiated in all directions rather than 
just the original direction of travel. As a result, there are narrow, 
dark lines in the solar spectrum corresponding to the specific 
wavelengths of absorption. Because each type of atom selectively absorbs
 different wavelengths, we can use the pattern of absorption lines (also
 called Fraunhofer lines) in the solar spectrum to determine the Sun's 
chemical composition. The distinct bright lines in the spectrum are 
caused by the opposite effect. Here the atoms in the Sun first absorb 
energy, but then emit this at a series of very specific wavelengths. 
Instead of blocking light, the atoms are strongly emitting at these 
wavelengths . Just as with absorption lines, the emission line patterns 
form a telltale signature for the type ofatoms inside the Sun (the 
element helium was first discovered in the Sun by spectroscopy before it
 was found on Earth). When a molecule absorbs high-energy radiation, and
 then re-emits it at a lower energy and thus longer wavelength, we call 
this "fluorescence." So-called Black Lights in discotheques use this 
phenomenon; they emit ultraviolet radiation that is invisible to us, and
 gets absorbed by certain materials that subsequently emit the energy as
 visible light. Although it 120<br>
<br>
 Instruments of Science<br>
<br>
may seem that white T-shirts and graffiti on walls are freely emitting 
light on their own, they are merely fluorescing. Again, the wavelengths 
at which materials fluoresce indicate what they are made of Apart from 
studying the Sun, we can apply all these phenomena to determine what 
planets consist of We can study the spectrum of the sunlight reflected 
by their surfaces and transmitted by their atmospheres; we can see which
 colors are reflected and which are absorbed by the rocks and the 
gasses. We can see the wavelengths at which the rocks are emitting 
themselves. We can also send down beams of radiation energy, such as 
radar waves, to see how they are reflected or scattered by the surface 
materials.<br>
<br>
IT'S ALL IN THE DATA The spacecraft instruments that make headlines in 
the newspaper are nearly always the optical cameras, the imagers that 
can register radiation at the wavelengths or frequencies of visible 
light. They give us beautiful pictures of the surface of Mars, or a 
mysteriously hazy view on what it's like on Saturn's moon Titan. Cameras
 show us what we would see with our own eyes if we were there ourselves.
 However, most interplanetary spacecraft carry many other types of 
instrument besides cameras for visible light. Often X-ray detectors, 
radiometers, mass spectrometers and ultraviolet imagers send back more 
interesting scientific data than the visible light cameras. After all, 
those imagers only cover the tiny part of the entire electromagnetic 
spectrum visible to human eyes, while planets radiate at many 
wavelengths. Most of the other types of radiation can only be seen by 
the specialized eyes on our robot probes. Sometimes we can convert that 
data into visible pictures, similar to a doctor making an X-ray photo 
ofa broken leg. Often such a picture shows something entirely different 
from how the object appears to us in visible light. A planet or moon may
 be dark and dull to a normal camera, but glowing in intricate patterns 
when viewed in infrared or ultraviolet. However, the data often comes in
 the form of endless rows of numbers that can only be interpreted by 
experts with specialized computer equipment. That information may need 
years of interpretation to be appreciated. However, it may be this stuff
 that really clarifies how alien some of those other places in the Solar
 System really are. Numeric data tells us what the atmospheric pressure 
is on Mars, and 121<br>
<br>
 Chapter 5 how the surface temperature varies during the day. This gives
 us a clue to whether we can expect liquid water to run somewhere on the
 surface, or whether we will only find solid ice underground. The data 
may show us how charged particles from the Sun and Jupiter's own moon 10
 are trapped in the giant planet's electromagnetic field, and how they 
are bombarding Jupiter's moons . The amount of dangerous radiation 
determines if we can ever hope to land astronauts there, or whether they
 would need impractically thick radiation shields to prevent them from 
being cooked. Analyzing the material that makes up a comet can help to 
prove the hypothesis that the building blocks for the complex molecules 
that make up daisies, dragon flies, dogs, algae and people were brought 
to Earth by these orbiting chunks of ice. Or it may show that this idea 
is pure nonsense. One way or another, investigating comets will teach us
 something about how life on Earth started billions ofyears ago, and how
 it may have started on other worlds too. Are comet impacts a vital 
ingredient or not?<br>
<br>
MANY EYES People and animals have eyes, a nose, ears, and a sense of 
taste and touch to interpret and survive in the world they live in. 
Interplanetary spacecraft often have similar senses plus a lot more that
 are not comparable to anything that exists in the biological world. 
Each scientific instrument takes a different look at the same planet, 
moon, asteroid or comet. Only by combining the data from all the 
different instruments does the entire picture become clear and we can 
really get some idea of what we are looking at. If you receive a bottle 
ofwine without a label your eyes will usually tell you what it is by the
 size and shape of the bottle. The color indicates whether the wine is 
white or red. Using your nose you can tell whether it is light and 
fruity or heavy and oaky. By tasting the wine, you are using the 
different areas ofyour tongue that specialize in sensing sweet, sour, 
salt and bitter to further determine what it is. By combining all the 
information, a good wine connoisseur is able to tell exactly the type of
 wine, where it came from and how it was made. Basing the decision only 
on taste, or only on smell, or only on what the wine looks like, the 
expert would seldom be able to make a determination with the same 
accuracy. 122<br>
<br>
 Instruments of Science If the expert took the wine into a chemistry lab
 with its array of specialized equipment, it would be possible to find 
out even more about the wine, such as the alcohol percentage and whether
 it contained added substances like sugar or window cleaner. Planetary 
scientists are like wine connoisseurs. They need information from all 
kinds of different instruments to determine the characteristics of an 
alien world. Therefore interplanetary spacecraft usually carry not just 
one, but a diversity of imagers and detectors.<br>
<br>
Visible light instruments Visible light instruments include normal 
cameras that gather light and project it on a light-sensitive 
surface,just like the camera with which you take your holiday pictures 
or videos. In early satellites and space probes, pictures were actually 
made on conventional film. Earth observation satellites could return 
that film by launching it back to Earth on board a small re-entry 
capsule. As that was much too complicated for interplanetary probes, 
these robots developed their film on board. This was done by putting a 
lamp on one side of the film and a light-sensitive sensor on the other 
side. Dark parts on the negative do not let much light through, while 
transparent areas do. In this way the film could be scanned by coding 
the amount of light the sensor received into series of l'sand 0's. The 
resulting numbers were then transmitted by radio to Earth , where they 
could be translated back into pictures. Later, improved systems were 
based on television camera technology. Images were made up by scanning 
an object line by line, encoding the data and sending it back to Earth. 
Modem space cameras work just like digital cameras that, on Earth, are 
now becoming more popular than film cameras. The captured light of an 
image falls directly on a sensor and is immediately digitally encoded. 
There is no longer a need for film or line-by-line scanning. The sensor 
that makes this possible is called a CCD, for Charged Coupled Device. A 
CCD consists of a vast matrix of detector elements, called pixels. Each 
pixel converts the energy of the light particles it receives into an 
electrical charge. The brighter the light that hits a CCD pixel, the 
higher the resulting electrical charge that accumulates on it. This 
electrical charge is subsequently converted into a code of l'sand O's, 
so it can be stored in the spacecraft's computer memory. The data is 
then relayed to Earth by radio, where the signals ofall individual 
pixels are combined according to the matrix layout in the camera. The 
end result is a 123<br>
<br>
 Chapter 5 complete picture from another world, much like your computer 
converts coded data in its memory into a picture on its screen. The 
individual images are in black and white, because the CCDs only register
 amounts of light and not its color. However, the cameras can make 
different images of the same object through different color filters . 
Using a red filter for instance means that what the CCDs register is the
 red light from the target; light of other colors cannot pass the 
filter. Combining the images made through a minimum of three filters 
(red, blue and yellow) allows us to create a realistic, full color 
image. Spacecraft observing planets from space often carry more than one
 camera. Optical instruments with a wide field of view can see a large 
part ofa planet, but not focus on small details. Cameras with a narrower
 field of view, called narrow-angle, cover less surface but may be able 
to show details less than a meter in width. The broad view, or 
wide-angle, systems are utilized on the Earthorbiting meteorological 
satellites that make the images for the weather forecast on television. 
On interplanetary spacecraft they are used to capture the results of 
massive geological forces, such as giant volcanoes, extensive canyons 
and enormous impact craters. Those that can focus on small objects - the
 narrow-angle cameras- can be used to study the edge of a crater, or the
 blocks of stone that were expelled by the impact of a large meteorite. 
When talking about space cameras, the word "resolution" is often used. 
The resolution is the size of the smallest objects that can still be 
individually distinguished on a picture made by a camera. For example, a
 system with a resolution of 2 meters can make out a car from space, but
 not the smaller object, the driver, standing next to it. With a 
resolution of a few centimeters you can read a newspaper's headlines 
from orbit (apparently modern Earth-orbiting spy satellites are able to 
do this, but no one working with them is allowed to admit that, of 
course) . In CCD cameras, the resolution is identical to the size of an 
object represented by one pixel on the digital photo . When you zoom in 
on such a picture, you'll see that it is built up of individual blocks. 
Each block represents a pixel and thus objects smaller than such a block
 cannot be seen as individual items. Another important parameter for a 
camera is its sensitivity- a measure for the weakest light source it is 
able to detect. It's similar to the ISO number for the film in 
conventional cameras. The higher the sensitivity, the less light is 
needed to make an image. The nice thing about visible light cameras is 
that they give us a look at a 124<br>
<br>
 Instruments of Science planet as ifwe were actually there. You don't 
need to be a trained scientist to recognize a huge canyon on a picture 
of Mars or a crater on the Moon. Because of this, the pictures in 
visible light are the ones that end up in newspapers and on the covers 
of popular magazines. They are turned into posters, downloaded to serve 
as wallpaper background for computers screens and decorate mouse pads, 
T-shirts and coffee mugs. With two cameras looking at the same thing 
under slightly different angles we can make stereoscopic images. When 
looking through a viewer that shows one image to your left eye and the 
other to your right eye, you get a perception of depth in the image. 
This is a great way to get a better understanding of a planet's 
landscape in three dimensions . Moreover, by using both images you can 
calculate the height of mountains and other features in the picture. 
Stereoscopic images make for great posters and popular books as well; 
the three-dimensional aspect can be cheaply reproduced by printing each 
picture in different colors and supplying a pair of glasses with one 
green and one red lens. The green lens allows only green light to pass, 
so that one eye sees only the green image and, similarly, your other eye
 sees only the red image. In this way each eye sees a different picture 
with a slightly different view angle, resulting in a three-dimensional 
image. NASA's Sojourner Marsrover and its two recent Mars Exploration 
Rovers had stereo-camera systems mounted to obtain 3-D images of the 
Martian landscape. ESA's Mars Express orbiter also makes stereoscopic 
images, but uses only one camera. As it flies over an area, it looks at 
features on the ground from different angles at different times.

 Chapter 5 computer on Earth, it is possible to create very rich 
stereoscopic images with an unprecedented amount of detail. Mars Express
 is the first spacecraft to apply this novel technology . Apart from 
making great pictures, visible light can also be used to make 
spectroscopic measurements. With a spectroscope you can see the overall 
spectrum of radiation an object reflects or emits, and the absorption 
and emission lines that indicate which atoms are present. With this 
information, you can thus find out the material something is made of, 
purely by the light you receive from it. For instance, we know very well
 what sunlight reflected by water looks like because we can study that 
here on Earth. If a satellite in orbit around another planet detected a 
spectrogram identical to that of water on Earth, we would know we have 
had found water on another world.<br>
<br>
There is more than meets the eye Cameras for visible light are great 
scientific instruments but they cannot see everything. First, they 
depend on reflected sunlight. They cannot see through clouds and murky 
atmospheres, and at night they cannot see anything. Rovers or landers on
 the surface may take their own lights with them, but you cannot light a
 whole planet from space. Second, with visible light you cannot see what
 is under the ground, or whether the ice on the Martian polar caps is 
made of water or frozen carbon dioxide. Objects with a temperature above
 absolute zero, and that is everything in the known Universe, emit 
radiation over a wide range of wavelengths. However, the wavelength at 
which an object emits the bulk of its energy depends on its temperature.
 Relatively cold objects radiate a lot in the infrared, while objects at
 extremely high temperatures mostly emit X-rays and gamma-rays. Visible 
light is thus not always the best way to look at something; an object 
that appears dull to our eyes may shine brightly at wavelengths that are
 invisible to us. Infrared systems, for instance, detect radiation with 
longer wavelengths than visible light. In visible light we see objects 
by the sunlight they reflect, but in infrared we can see them by their 
self-emission, i.e. the radiation the objects give off because of their 
temperature. People and animals keep themselves warm and therefore 
usually have a higher temperature than their surroundings. Because of 
this they emit more infrared radiation and thus show up brightly on 
infrared camera images. Infrared detectors thus also work at night, 
which is why on Earth we use them in security systems for houses, shops 
and offices.<br>
<br>
126<br>
<br>
 Instruments of Science<br>
<br>
For these reasons spacecraft observing planets, comets and asteroids 
typically carry a range of instruments with them, each specialized in 
detecting radiation within a certain range of wavelengths or at a 
particular wavelength. In infrared you can, for instance, measure how a 
planet's surface cools off at night. This is very interesting, because 
it can say something about its composition, or how well its atmosphere 
acts as a blanket. Microwave instruments detect radiation with 
wavelengths between those of the far infrared and the shortest 
wavelength radio waves. You cannot individually distinguish objects that
 are smaller than the wavelength of the radiation you are measuring, so 
the resolution of microwave instruments is less than for visible light 
imagers. However, they can collect unique information over very large 
areas. Passive microwave radiometers detect radio waves from the Sun 
that are reflected by a planet. They are mainly used on 
Earth-observation satellites, for measuring the sea surface temperature 
and sea ice coverage, and to get information about the amount of water 
on the surface and in the ground. Microwave radiometers can even be used
 to measure wind velocities, as it was discovered that wind changes the 
way radio waves are reflected by the sea. Radar systems are active forms
 of instruments, because they generate the needed radio waves themselves
 and then look at how a surface or object reflects that radiation. 
Radars thus do not need any sunlight or radiation emitted by an object 
itself The principle is the same as in radar systems on board ships and 
airplanes. Radars are very powerful instruments. For example, they are 
capable of looking through cloudy atmospheres and some can even look 
through solid material - similar to the way radio waves can go through 
the walls in your house so that the radio also works indoors. With 
certain types of radar you can see what is underground, beneath the 
planet's surface, because each layer in the ground will reflect some of 
the radio waves. With radar you can also measure the distance between 
your spacecraft and the surface below. Because the radio waves travel 
with the speed of light, you can calculate the distance by determining 
how long it takes the waves to reach the surface and reflect back to the
 instrument. Radar can thus be used to measure the relief or 
"topography" of a planet's surface: the height of the mountains and the 
depth of the craters. Moreover, the roughness of the surface ofa planet 
influences the way in which the radar waves are reflected back to the 
receiver. A smooth ice plane reflects the waves back without much 
disturbance, but a rough and rocky surface scatters a big part of the 
waves in different directions . With a 127<br>
<br>
 Chapter 5 radar you can thus not only gauge the topography of a 
planetary surface, but also the overall properties of the surface 
materials. NASA's Magellan spacecraft used a sophisticated radar to make
 detailed maps of the surface of Venus, which is hidden from us by a 
very thick, almost opaque atmosphere ("almost," because visual and 
ultraviolet radiation are blocked, but some infrared radiation gets 
through). The instrument combined the unique features of radar by 
peering through the murky atmosphere and also measuring the topography 
of the terrain. From 1990 until 1994 it orbited Earth's sister planet 
and gave us the most detailed map of the surface of Venus ever. The 
MARSIS experiment on board ESA's Mars Express involves three long 
antennas that send low-frequency radio waves toward the planet it 
orbits. Most of the radio waves bounce back from the surface ofMars, but
 a significant fraction travels through the crust. This energy is 
reflected where layers of different materials meet - for instance, at 
the border between water and ice. MARSIS maps the planet's subsurface 
structure to a depth of a few kilometers. It is able to measure the 
thickness ofthe sand in dune areas and where layers of sedimentation are
 covering other material. MARSIS also studies the ionosphere ofMars, an 
electrically charged region of the upper atmosphere that also reflects 
some radio waves. Mter the launch ofMars Express, new computer analyses 
indicated that during the deployment process the long antennas could 
possibly whip against the spacecraft and might damage it. The deployment
 of MARSIS was therefore delayed until sufficient data from the other 
instruments had been collected and the problem had been studied more 
carefully. Nearly one and a half years into the mission, it was decided 
that the time had come to extend the antennas. However, after the 
deployment of the first 20-meter (66-foot) antenna, analysis by flight 
controllers at ESA's European Space Operations Center in Germany showed 
that one of the outermost segments had deployed but was not locked into 
position . Engineers speculated that the long storage in the cold 
expanses of space could have affected the fiberglass and Kevlar material
 ofthe antenna boom. The mission team therefore decided to swing Mars 
Express so that the Sun could heat the cold side of the antenna. They 
hoped that as the cold side expanded in the heat, it would force the 
unlocked segment into place. Mter an hour, Mars Express was pointed back
 at Earth so that its highgain antenna could be used for communications 
again. The data it sent showed that all antenna segments had now 
successfully locked . Just over a month later, and after careful 
analyses, the second radar boom was deployed without a hitch. This time,
 ESA controllers had put 128<br>
<br>
 Instruments of Science Mars Express into a slow spin to ensure that the
 boom and its hinges would be evenly warmed by the Sun as it extended. 
The shorter third and final antenna was also deployed a few days later, 
and MARSIS could finally start its work. Its first findings included 
buried impact craters, layered deposits at the north pole and hints of 
the presence of deep underground water-ice. Layers oflava that cover 
some of the buried crater walls indicate that Mars was once a 
geologically active planet. A new way of measuring the distance between a
 spacecraft and the ground is by use of laser altimeter instruments. 
These fire short pulses of laser light down to the surface and record 
the time it takes to receive a reflected signal. They are more accurate 
than radars because they operate at shorter wavelengths and have more 
focused beams, but cannot see what is beneath the surface. There is a 
range of other instruments an orbiter can use to study a planet. As an 
example, let's first have a look at what is on board Messenger, the NASA
 spacecraft that is on its way to Mercury now.<br>
<br>
MESSENGER'S INSTRUMENTS Messenger's suite ofdiverse scientific 
instruments is designed to find out as much as possible about Mercury, 
the planet closest to the Sun. We already know that Mercury has an 
unusually high density, indicating that it has a large metallic core 
(heavy metals tend to sink down) accounting for about two-thirds of the 
planet's mass, covered with a layer of rocky material (silicate) with a 
lower density. The metallic core probably has a diameter about 
three-quarters of that of the planet, which makes it proportionally the 
largest of any known planetary body. The Earth's metallic core is much 
smaller in relation to the size of our planet, comprising only about 
one-third of its total mass. There are some theories that try to explain
 why Mercury has such a large core, or, from an alternative perspective,
 such a thin silicate mantle. One suggests that Mercury was initially 
created more normally, but a collision with another planet blasted off 
most of its outer layer. Or maybe the young, extremely hot Sun 
evaporated a large part of the mantle. On the other hand, Mercury may 
have simply been born the way it is. Messenger's instruments are 
designed to help us to find out what really happened . The 
spacecraftcarries spectrometer instruments that are able to measure 129<br>
<br>
 Chapter 5 how different areas on Mercury emit X-rays, gamma-rays and 
neutron particles. Elements such as oxygen, silicon and iron emit 
gamma-rays when hit by cosmic radiation coming from deep space. At the 
same time, certain naturally radioactive elements emit gamma-rays by 
themselves. All this will be measured by Messenger's Gamma-Ray and 
Neutron Spectrometer, or GRNS, instrument. It will be able to measure 
what the surface consists of to a depth of about 10 centimeters (4 
inches). GRNS will also detect low-energy neutron particles that are 
created when cosmic radiation hits hydrogen-rich material, down to about
 40 centimeters (1.3 feet) below the surface. This makes the instrument 
useful for finding water-ice at the poles ofMercury, were it may be 
hiding in the cold shadows inside craters where sunshine never manages 
to reach. The X-Ray Spectrometer, or XRS, measures emissions at X-ray 
wavelengths that are caused by radiation from the Sun that strikes the 
planet's surface. X-rays from the Sun cause atoms in the Mercury surface
 to fluoresce and emit X-rays of their own. The precise energy carried 
by these X-rays is a signature of the element emitting it. XRS will give
 similar information as the GRNS instrument, but only detects the 
elements in the upper 1 millimeter (0.04 inch) of the surface. Together 
these spectrometers will thus be able to tell us what elements can be 
found on Mercury, how they are spread over the planet's surface, and how
 their abundances differ between the visible first upper millimeter and 
the layers lower down. The Mercury Atmospheric and Surface Composition 
Spectrometer, MASCS , is an instrument that is sensitive to light from 
infrared to ultraviolet wavelengths. Apart from also helping to find out
 the kind of minerals that are present on the surface, it will be able 
to detect the various gases the extremely tenuous atmosphere of Mercury 
contains. Employing all these instruments, Messenger will provide 
scientists with a map of the elements that are present on the 
surface,just under it, and in the atmosphere. This geological and 
chemical information is vital for checking the credibility of the 
various theories that exist about the formation of Mercury billions of 
years ago. Since about 55 percent of Mercury's surface has never been 
photographed at close range, one of the main mission objectives of 
Messenger is to map the entire planet. We will see areas that the 
Mariner 10 spacecraft was not able to shoot during its short flybys in 
the mid1970s. Moreover, we will see these and the already known part of 
the surface with much more detail than ever before. The Mercury Dual 
Imaging System, MDIS, consists of a wide-angle 130<br>
<br>
 Instruments of Science and a narrow-angle imager. The wide-angle camera
 also incorporates a wheel with filters that can be rotated into its 
field of view one at a time. Using these, the instrument can be used for
 spectroscopic imaging, because each filter only lets through light with
 a particular wavelength. The wide-angle camera can therefore give 
additional information about what the surface of Mercury consists of 
MDIS will also be used to make stereoscopic images of Mercury by 
combining photos made of the same area from different positions in 
space. This will show the relief of the surface in better detail than 
normal pictures, because it will provide a 3-D view of the planet. To 
map the relief on Mercury, Messenger furthermore incorporates an 
altitude-measuring instrument called the Mercury Laser Altimeter, MLA. 
This contains a laser that sends pulses of laser light down to the 
planet's surface and a sensor that collects the light after it has been 
reflected. The instrument measures the amount of time it takes the light
 to make a round-trip to the surface and back, enabling scientist to 
determine the height of features on the surface. With this information, 
and accurate knowledge ofthe spacecraft's orbit, they can then make very
 exact maps of Mercury's topography. Our Earth has a strong magnetic 
field because of the movements in its liquid metal core. Mercury's core 
is much smallerin actual size (but not as a percentage of the total 
mass) and therefore should have cooled down and become solid a long time
 ago. A solid metal core does not create a magnetic field, but the 
Mariner 10 spacecraft nevertheless found one at Mercury. The core may 
somehow have remained liquid, or the current field may be the original 
field's remains, still left "frozen" in the now solid core. A 
magnetometer has been put on board Messenger to measure the strength and
 direction of the magnetic field. This instrument will map Mercury's 
magnetic field and will search for regions of magnetized rocks in the 
crust. To minimize the disturbance by the spacecraft's own magnetic 
field caused by its electrical components, the magnetometer is placed at
 a distance, at the end of a 3.6-meter (12-foot) boom. Since Mercury has
 a magnetic field, it also has a magnetosphere. A magnetosphere is the 
region surrounding the planet in which electrically charged particles 
are controlled by the magnetic field of the planet rather than by the 
Sun's magnetic field, which is carried by the solar wind. Planetary 
magnetospheres can attract and trap charged particles coming from the 
Sun and interstellar space. The Energetic Particle and Plasma 
Spectrometer, EPPS, will measure the composition, distribution and 
energy of these charged particles (electrons and various ions) in 
Mercury's magnetosphere. 131<br>
<br>
 Chapter 5 The Radio Science experiment does not use a specialized 
instrument, but makes use ofMessenger's normal radio communication 
system. When the spacecraft moves away from us, the radio waves we 
receive will be " stretched" and we will therefore detect the signal on a
 slightly lower radiofrequency. When Messenger moves toward us, the 
radio waves will be "compressed," resulting in a slightly higher 
frequency. This is called the Doppler effect. By measuring this effect, 
we can detect slight changes in the spacecraft's velocity as it orbits 
Mercury. These changes are the result of the fact that the gravitational
 field of Mercury is not completely homogeneous. Some parts of the 
planet have a bit more mass and thus a slightly greater local 
gravitational pull than other parts. As a result, spacecraft orbiting 
Mercury will not move in perfectly smooth orbits, but will be disturbed 
in their movement. Studying the Doppler effect on Messenger's radio 
signals allows scientists to learn about Mercury's mass distribution, 
including the variations in the thickness of its crust.<br>
<br>
ROVING AROUND Rovers driving around on a planet's surface need to have 
different instruments to orbiting spacecraft. Rather than seeing large 
areas from high above, they investigate soil and rocks on the spot. 
Rovers resemble animals more than orbiting spacecraft, and often have a 
long boom "neck" that enables the cameras to be high enough to get a 
good overview of the terrain. The cameras have multiple "eyes" to give 
them a stereoscopic view and a sense ofdepth. Some rovers also have arms
 that can reach out to inspect and sample rocks and soil. Because of 
their mobility and likeness to living beings, rovers are popular topics 
for toys. In 1997, after the landing of the real one, the Mars company 
gave away small Sojourner Marsrovers with packs of their candy bars. 
More recently, the LEGO company issued a Mars Exploration Rover with 
functional deployment systems, wheels, steering mechanism, moving 
antenna and camera head, and even an extendable experiment arm. NASA's 
Mars Exploration Rovers (MERs) Spirit and Opportunity, the inspiration 
for the LEGO toy, landed early 2004 on different sides of the planet. 
Their sets of instruments were especially selected to determine whether 
Mars was once a more friendly place where life may have evolved. The 
evidence was expected to be found in the rocks, of which the 132<br>

composition would hopefully betray whether they had formed in a watery 
environment a couple of billion years ago. Each identical rover 
contained a panoramic camera and a spectrometer on the rover's body, and
 a set of instruments on a mechanical arm to analyze rocks and soil. A 
grinder on this arm could be used to scrape away the outer layers of 
rocks so that the pristine material inside could be investigated. The 
panoramic camera of each rover consisted of two high-resolution stereo 
cameras on top of a mast in front of the vehicle. Positioned 1.5 meters 
(5 feet) above ground level, they acted as the eyes of the robot and 
made it possible to create three-dimensional panoramic images of the 
terrain. The images the two golf-cart-sized rovers sent back to Earth 
showed an unprecedented amount of detail. We saw vast, wind-swept 
landscapes of red and brown rocks covered in rust-colored dust, large 
craters and exposed layers of sedimentation that were probably deposited
 by liquid water. They showed sunrises and sunsets through the orange 
atmosphere, 133<br>
<br>
 Chapter 5 and dunes of fine dust. Looking through the eyes of the 
rovers, you can imagine being on Mars yourself Parts of the MERs are 
also shown on the pictures. You can see the solar cells and the bolts, 
the wheels and the tracks they left behind. It seems fantastic that 
something constructed on Earth by human hands is now so far away, placed
 on the red, desolate surface of another world! Each camera system 
carried 14 different types of filters, so that spectroscopic images 
could be made in different colors. Spectral analysis of the rocks, soil 
and the atmosphere helped to determine their composition. Because the 
scientists didn't know exactly what color and brightness the light on 
Mars would be, it was hard for them to accurately fine-tune the pictures
 they receive. It's like getting a very red, dark picture of your 
friends made in a dimly lit bar. Without anything else you cannot say 
whether the film was wrongly developed or whether the light in the room 
was really that red and weak. You need a clue, an object of known color 
on the picture - a base on which you can adjust the image. Therefore the
 rovers carried so-called calibration targets with patterns of known 
colors. The scientists adjusted their pictures so that the colors on the
 pictures matched what they knew the calibration target should look 
like. As a result, all the colors on the pictures of the Martian surface
 could also be corrected to be realistic. When the first pictures from 
the Viking landers came back in the 1970s, photo interpreters 
incorrectly assumed that the sky on Mars would look as it does on Earth .
 Therefore they adjusted the colors on the first pictures in such a way 
that the sky looked blue. However, once the pictures were correctly 
calibrated, they realized that the Martian sky was actually a shade of 
pink, because of all the rusty dust it contains! The MERs carried 
panoramic camera calibration targets in the shape of a sundial. The 
corners of the sundial had colored blocks for adjusting the camera's 
sense of color. The shadows cast by its center post allowed scientists 
to correctly scale the brightness of each image. Moreover, to get young 
people involved in space exploration, children were encouraged to track 
the time on Mars using the sundial as part of NASA's Red Rover Goes to 
Mars education program. Another instrument on the rover's bodies was the
 Mini-Thermal Emission Spectrometer, which could see the infrared heat 
signature emitted by Martian surface features. It could determine the 
mineral composition ofsoil and rocks from far away. The spectrometer 
could even see through the dust that coats most of the rocks on Mars. 
The main part of this instrument was housed inside the rover, but the 
mast for the cameras was used as a periscope so that it could get a good
 134<br>
<br>
 Instruments of Science view of the terrain: a mirror assembly on top of
 the boom reflected the infrared light from outside down through the 
mast into the spectrometer. With this instrument, scientistsand 
operators could determine whether it was worth taking the rover in for a
 closer look, or better to move on and find a geologically more 
interesting location. The spectrometers on the two rovers were also 
pointed upward to make the first-ever highresolution temperature 
profiles through the atmosphere of Mars. For detailed measurements, the 
rovers had an instrumented mechanical arm on the front that could be 
extended against rocks and the ground. It also incorporated a Rock 
Abrasion Tool that could grind dust and weathered outer layers of rocks,
 so that the pristine material inside was exposed for investigation. It 
was the equivalent of a geologist's hammer, which is used to break rocks
 to be able to see what they're made of The Microscopic Imager on the 
arm, a combination of a microscope and a camera, was used to make 
extreme close-up images in black-andwhite of the rocks and soils. The 
imager could see tiny grains of minerals embedded in the rocks, and 
measure the shape and size of particles in the Martian soil. It was 
hoped that it would also be able to see fossils of microbes, but none 
was found. Iron is a very common material on Mars. In fact, the surface 
looks red because of the oxidized "rusted" dust. The scientists thus 
needed an instrument specifically designed to determine the composition 
and amount of iron-bearing minerals and the magnetic properties of the 
iron. With this information, they learned a lot about what Mars was like
 when these minerals were formed. The instrument that could do this was a
 Mossbauer Spectrometer. Germany provided two of these to NASA for its 
Mars Exploration Rovers. The spectrometer used two tiny pieces of 
radioactive cobalt-57 to radiate the samples with gamma-rays. The 
spectrometer then analyzed how the radiation got absorbed by the sample 
to gain information about the iron (the absorption is known as the 
"Mossbauer effect," hence the instrument's name). The Mossbauer 
Spectrometer on the rover Spirit found an iron-bearing mineral called 
goethite in a rock in the Columbia Hills of Mars. As this mineral is 
normally produced only in the presence of water, the examination of the 
rock produced strong evidence that there was once water in the area that
 Spirit explored. The scientists called this particularly interesting 
rock "Clovis." It is a geologists tradition to give interesting sites 
and rocks a name, to enable them to be easily referred to. Names are 
easier to remember than boring numbers and codes. 135<br>

The rover arm also included another type of spectrometer, called the 
Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer, which was also built in Germany. It 
works somewhat similar to a Mossbauer Spectrometer, but uses Alpha 
particles (radiation consisting of subatomic fragments with two protons 
and two neutrons) and X-rays emitted by small amounts of radioactive 
curium-244. It was used to determine which other elements make up the 
rocks and soil on Mars. Each rover also carried a set of three Magnet 
Arrays, supplied by Denmark, to collect dust. There is a lot of dust on 
Mars and, because of the high iron content, some of it is magnetic. The 
magnetic minerals in the fine dust may be freeze-dried remnants from the
 time that Mars was a much wetter planet. One set ofmagnets was put on 
the Rock Abrasive Tool, so that it could gather the dust that resulted 
from the tool grinding through the outer layers of the rocks. By looking
 at the amounts and the patterns the dust made as it accumulated on 
magnets with different strengths, scientists got indications of the 
composition of the dust, which includes iron. Another set ofmagnets was 
mounted on the front ofthe rover to collect airborne dust. The dust 
collected on these magnets could be reached by 136<br>
<br>
 Instruments of Science the mechanical ann's Mossbauer and Alpha 
Particle X-Ray Spectrometers, which could also be used to analyze the 
Martian dust. A third magnet was mounted on top of the rover and was 
powerful enough to collect dust blown over the vehicle by the wind. The 
dust on this magnet could be viewed by the panoramic camera. In addition
 to the main suite of instruments, some equipment that was mainly used 
for engineering and operational reasons could also be employed to give a
 better idea of the geology of the area. The Hazard Identification 
Cameras, mounted low on the front and back of each rover, provided 
120-degree stereoscopic black-and-white images. These were used to help 
to find obstacles in the vicinity of the rover, and for steering the 
rover's mechanical ann with its abrasion tool and instruments. The 
Navigation Camera also consisted of a stereo pair of black-andwhite 
imagers. It sat on top of the mast, together with the Panoramic Camera. 
However, it could make pictures with a much wider angle, to give quick 
full-circle views of the rover's location. If the Panoramic Camera was 
used for this purpose, the rover would need to send a lot more data to 
Earth and would therefore take much more time. The rover's wheels were, 
of course, mainly used for mobility, but could also dig shallow trenches
 to show soil properties and expose fresh soil that could then be 
investigated by the instruments. The two rovers each landed in very 
different terrain. Spirit came down in the Gusev Crater, and found it to
 consist of volcanic rocks that had obviously been little affected by 
water. However, when it started to clamber into the Columbia Hills, it 
found rocks that had been ground into small grains, then glued back 
together with salt. This salt must first have been dissolved in liquid 
water to get between the grains, and when the water evaporated the salt 
cemented the grains to each another. Spirit also found the earlier 
mentioned concentrations of goethite mineral. Nevertheless, the rover 
provided no evidence that large amounts of water had ever been present 
for extended periods. In contrast, on the other side of the planet, 
Opportunity saw terrain that had clearly been shaped by lots and lots of
 water. Near the small crater in which it had landed, it spotted an 
outcropping oflayered rocks that was clearly built up of sediments 
deposited by water. Moreover, these rocks were found to contain very 
high amounts of sulfate, indicating that they had been formed by the 
evaporation of sulfur-rich, standing water. Opportunity's cameras then 
made close-ups ofcurious, small stony balls embedded in the rock and 
scattered allover the ground. The geologists 137<br>

quickly dubbed them "blueberries." The instruments on the rover's arm 
determined these to consist of hematite. While hematite can be deposited
 by volcanic lavas, it is often formed in the presence of water. The MER
 discoveries, together with the global data obtained from the various 
Mars orbiters, seems to indicate that Mars was once covered with rivers,
 lakes and perhaps oceans. However, water may have only occasionally and
 briefly flowed through them. Mars seems to have been mostly a frozen 
planet for the last couple of billion years. Although it may never have 
looked like Earth, the planet probably once looked a lot more friendly 
than it does now. Operating all the scientific equipment on board the 
rovers was quite a job. During their main mission of three months, the 
MERs required a science team of 50 people and an engineering team of 30,
 equally distributed over the two rovers. The 40 team members per rover 
worked in two shifts. At the beginning of each Mars day the scientists 
would meet to decide on the new activities, according to the mission 
plan, past experience and the situation in which the rovers were left 
the previous evening (during the Martian night, without sunlight for the
 solar arrays, the MERs were "sleeping"). Their decisions were then 
conveyed to the engineering team, 138<br>
<br>
 Instruments of Science who were tasked with preparing the commands and 
relaying them to the rovers. The operators often had to work at very 
strange times, because their shifts were not following normal time on 
Earth , but were dictated by the local time on Mars. When it was midday 
at one of the rover's location, it could be in the middle of the night 
at the NASA operations center. Moreover, the two rovers were driving 
around on opposite sides of Mars, so while it was daytime for the Spirit
 rover team, it was night-time for those working with Opportunity. In 
addition, a Martian day, called a "Sol," is equivalent to roughly 24 
hours 37 minutes on Earth. As a result, the team's working hours were 
moving 37 minutes later each day with respect to the time on their Earth
 clocks; Initially operating the delicate and expensive rovers was done 
one step at a time. A typical sequence would go something like this. On 
Day 1, the rover is commanded to drive a meter or so toward a 
preselected rock and take a photo for navigation purposes. The view on 
the picture and the' overall situation are then evaluated in order to 
prepare the commands for Day 2, during which the MER is told to drive a 
bit closer and take more pictures. On Day 3 the Rock Abrasive Tool is 
put against the rock to scrape away the outer surface, and a picture is 
taken of the resulting cleaned spot. On Day 4 the Microscopic Imager and
 the spectrometers on the arm are employed to study the exposed, fresh 
material. On Day 5 the results are studied and if the data is 
satisfactory the MER can be commanded to move on, but if not, then 
additional measurements may need to be taken. On Day 6, the rover might 
then be instructed to prepare to head for a new target. The data we 
obtained from the MER instruments tells us that their landing sites, 
especially those of Opportunity, are full of clues to a watery past. The
 rovers found minerals that only form in the presence of water, and saw 
rocks that showed fine layers that were truncated, discordant and at 
angles to each other typical of sediments laid down in flowing water. It
 now seems certain that large amounts of liquid water must once have 
existed on the surface of Mars. The big questions remaining are how long
 Mars existed as a relatively wet (and warmer) planet, and whether its 
existence was long enough for life to have evolved. If so, did life also
 actually start there or not? Ifit didn't, we should ask ourselves why 
it happened on Earth and not on Mars. The riddles of the red desert 
planet are bound to keep us busy for quite some time!<br>

DNING THROUGH AN ATMOSPHERE A breed apart are probes that are not 
designed to orbit a planet or to land on it, but primarily to 
investigate its atmosphere. Descending under parachutes, these probes 
soak up atmospheric gasses for analyses, and measure temperatures , 
pressures and densities as they go down. Naturally these missions don't 
last long, so all payload instruments have to work flawlessly from the 
moment the protecting heatshields fall off. There is no margin for 
error, and no time to fix bugs or do experiments another time. It's a 
"one chance only" situation. In 1995 NASA's Galileo orbiter arrived at 
Jupiter. It carried a 339kilogram (747-pound) probe that was ejected to 
descend into Jupiter's atmosphere . Once decelerated to a mere 100 
kilometers (62 miles) per hour by the atmospheric drag, the probe 
ejected its protecting heatshields and continued to descend for about an
 hour, measuring gas compositions, temperatures, pressures and wind 
speeds. At a depth of 130 kilometers (80 miles) the short but exciting 
mission ended abruptly when the Galileo entry probe was destroyed by a 
pressure of 25 times that on the Earth's surface and a temperature over 
150 degrees Celsius (300 degrees Fahrenheit) . NASA and ESA are studying
 probes that may venture even deeper into Jupiter's atmosphere than 
Galileo. However, no probe will ever be able to reach the heart of 
Jupiter, as the pressures and temperatures there are much too high for 
any type of machine. In 1997 NASA, ESA and the Italian Space Agency 
launched their combined Cassini-Huygens mission, the most ambitious 
effort in robotic planetary space exploration ever. Its target was the 
planet Saturn, the "Lord of the Rings ." It would take no less than 
seven years and a series of flybys of Venus, Earth and Jupiter to arrive
 at its destination. The giant gas planet Saturn, second in size only to
 Jupiter, consists mostly of hydrogen and helium and shows intricate 
bands of clouds in various beautiful shades ofbrown and yellow. However,
 it is most famous for its complex system of bright rings made of rock 
and ice particles, ranging in size from grains of sand to as large as a 
truck . The NASA orbiter Cassini, named after the famous Italian-French 
astronomer who studied Saturn in the seventeenth century, was designed 
to get into orbit around Saturn and investigate the planet and its 
beautiful rings from close up. The continuously changing orbital 
inclination of Cassini allows it to explore the environment around the 
planet over a wide range oflatitudes. Moreover, its varying orbit allows
 the spacecraft to roam around the planet's fantastic collection of 
strange and fascinating moons. 140<br>

Cassini was also acting as a mothership for the ESA probe Huygens, named
 after the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens , who discovered Titan in
 1655. Huygens was designed to investigate the thick atmosphere of 
Saturn's largest moon, Titan. The probe was decoupled from Cassini 
nearly six months after arrival at Saturn, because only then would the 
orbits of the orbiter, the ejected probe and Titan all be aligned in the
 right way. Then the 320-kilogram (700-pound) probe entered Titan's 
atmosphere while protected by a large heatshield made of carbon fiber. 
Once the velocity had diminished sufficiently, parachutes further slowed
 the probe down and let it drift toward the surface. While measuring 
important properties ofthe atmosphere, Huygens sent its findings to 
Cassini, which stored the data on its onboard computer and then 
forwarded it to Earth. Although not specifically designed as a lander, 
Huygens was expected to reach Titan's surface and give us the first 
views ever of what it looks like. And it did.<br>

Primeval soup No moon in the Solar System is more mysterious than Titan,
 which is actually larger than the planet Mercury and our own Moon. It 
is the only moon with a substantial atmosphere, consisting mostly of 
nitrogen but laced with a mixture of gases called hydrocarbons, 
especially methane. Titan's surface cannot be seen from space; it is 
hidden behind a brownish-orange haze. This mist consists of complex 
organic molecules (molecules based on chains of carbon atoms, like those
 in our body) that are created in the upper atmosphere. Under the 
influence of the Sun's ultraviolet radiation, methane molecules are 
broken apart and recombine in the form of new organic molecules. The 
smoggy, globe-enshrouding haze forms clouds that resemble car exhaust 
fumes, from which scientists expected a rain of complex molecules to be 
falling down to the surface. Far from the Sun, Titan is thought to be a 
deep-frozen memory of the early Solar System. Scientist think that the 
conditions on its surface and in its atmosphere make it much like an 
early Earth of around 4 billion years ago, but in deep freeze, before 
life began to evolve and filled the atmosphere with oxygen. Titan's 
brownish veil of chemicals and the organic goo raining down on the 
surface may resemble the primeval soup in which the first living 
organisms on our planet once appeared. Earlier, information on Titan had
 been collected by powerful telescopes on Earth, space telescopes in 
Earth orbit and most importantly the Voyagers 1 and 2 spacecraft that, 
respectively, flew by in 1980 and 1981. The data indicated that the 
pressure at Titan's surface must be about 1.5 times that on the surface 
on Earth, and that the temperature there is about -180 degrees Celsius 
(-290 degrees Fahrenheit). However, apart for some idea of the 
composition and average surface pressure, not much was known about 
Titan's atmosphere. Were the scientific models that predicted liquids of
 complex organic molecules on the surface correct? Could it really rain 
on Titan? To answer these questions, and others, scientists equipped 
Huygens with a range of instruments to gain as much data as possible 
during its short descent.<br>
<br>
Going down<br>
<br>
Let's go back to December 2004 andfollow Huygens as if we are flying 
along with it, starting just before its epic descent into the mysterious
 atmosphere of Titan. On Christmas Day 2004, after a final system check,
 Huygens is ejected from the Cassini orbiter. To spare the batteries, 
everything on board the 142<br>
<br>
 Instruments of Science probe is turned off, except for a timer system 
to activate the sleeping robot when the moment of truth comes. For 22 
days Huygens journeys quietly and passively toward mystifying Titan. 
Then, on January 14, it gets its wake-up call from the timer system. 
Huygens comes alive, feeding power from the batteries to all its 
subsystems and scientific instruments. Hours later the giant Green Bank 
radio telescope in the USA is the first to pick up the faint beacon 
signal of Huygens directly. The signal is far too weak to carry any 
data, but it is the earliest indication that Huygens works. Hearing 
Huygens directly is quite a feat, similar to receiving a mobile phone 
signal from Saturn. Four-and-a-half minutes after activation Huygens 
slams into Titan's upper atmosphere at 65,000 kilometers (40,000 miles) 
per hour, fast enough to fly across the USA coast to coast in about 2.5 
minutes. Within 3 minutes the atmospheric drag reduces the speed to 
1,500 kilometers (930 miles) per hour. The huge amount of energy that 
the capsule has in terms ofvelocity (kinetic energy) is mostly 
transformed into heat. It makes the temperature of the front of Huygens'
 protective shield race up to 11,000 degrees Celsius (21,000 degrees 
Fahrenheit), about twice the surface temperature of the Sun. Then, after
 having been packed inside its container for over nine years, a small 
pilot chute comes out and pulls away the aft protective shield that is 
covering the probe itself Almost immediately, still 180 kilometers (110 
miles) above the surface, a large parachute unfurls to further slow down
 the falling explorer. On Earth the atmosphere only starts to be 
noticeable at an altitude ofabout 100 kilometers (62 miles), but Titan's
 atmosphere is much thicker. Thirty seconds after opening, the main 
parachute has brought the remaining velocity down to 320 kilometers (200
 miles) per hour, and the front protective shield is ejected. The 
parachute is relatively large to ensure that Huygens descends much 
J:llore slowly than the falling shield. This prevents the probe from 
accidentally slamming into it. Now Huygens is completely free, and its 
instruments start their investigation of the atmosphere . The data is 
sent to Cassini, which is passing by Titan at a distance of60,000 
kilometers (37,000 miles). Cassini will store all the information, then 
dispatch it to Earth via a much more powerful radio signal than the 
Huygens probe can provide . For 15 minutes Huygens gently glides down 
under the large parachute. The atmosphere is getting thicker and 
thicker, further slowing down the probe. Soon the rate of descend is so 
low that if Huygens continues like that the batteries might be empty 
before it reaches the surface. Therefore the main parachute is released 
at an 143<br>
<br>
 Chapter 5 altitude of 138 kilometers (85 miles) and a smaller drogue 
chute with less drag takes over. A bit faster, Huygens continues the 
descent through the T itan atmosphere for the next two hours, its 
instruments busy with collecting valuable scientific information. NASA's
 Gas Chromatograph and Mass Spectrometer (GCMS) instrument identifies 
and quantifies the gasses comprising Titan's atmosphere. It measures the
 elements that are expected to exist, including carbon, nitrogen, 
hydrogen, oxygen, argon and neon, but also looks for new, unpredicted 
ones. Using this data, scientists hope to gain new insights into the 
chemical evolution on Titan and its possible relevance to the conditions
 on the early Earth . GCMS is equipped with gas samplers that are filled
 early during the descent at high altitude, when the probe is still 
going very fast. The analysis of these samples is done later in the 
descent, when more time is available. The Aerosol Collector and 
Pyrolyser is designed to collect aerosols, small droplets floating in 
the atmosphere, and subject them to a chemical composition analysis. It 
consists ofa sampling device that extends from the probe, a pump to suck
 in the atmosphere, and a series of filters to capture the aerosols. The
 aerosols are then routed to NASA's GCMS instrument for analysis. The 
Huygens Atmosphere Structure Instrument comprises various sensors for 
measuring the physical and electrical properties of the atmosphere, such
 as wind velocities, air temperatures and lightning discharges. It also 
incorporates a microphone that records sounds of the droning winds at 
Titan. The Doppler Wind Experiment makes use of the radio signals that 
Huygens continuously sends to Cassini. The wind on Titan makes Huygens 
drift, inducing a measurable Doppler frequency shift in the signal. The 
Descent Imager/Spectral Radiometer of the University of Arizona is an 
optical instrument with a number ofdifferent detectors. It is designed 
to shoot pictures of the surface of Titan and the clouds in the 
atmosphere, and to make spectrographic measurements to find out what 
they are made<br>
<br>
o£ At an altitude of 30 kilometers (19 miles) the thick orange haze 
opens up, and the imager can finally see the surface. Its images show 
mountains of clear ice, caught in a net of river channels filled with 
dark deposits. The dark material probably consists of complex organic 
molecules that the rain washes down the mountains. It also sees what 
looks like a coastline along a dried up lake. 144<br>
<br>

FIGURE 5.7 This image made by the Huygens probe from high altitude shows what looks like riversfull if dark material. [ESA]<br>
<br>
Once Huygens is only a hundred meters or so above the surface, the 
instrument switches on a lamp to have a better look at the surface from 
nearby. The probe heads for a landing close to a border between the dark
 and light material. Finally, Huygens hits the ground at 5 meters (16 
feet) per second and the Surface Science Package can finally get into 
action. It has been specifically designed to find out what kind of 
surface Huygens lands on, in case the probe makes it that far 
(officially, Huygens was designed as an atmosphere investigator, not as a
 lander). The theoretical possibilities for the ground range from a 
rocky surface to methane-ice or snow, or even methane or ethane lakes 
and seas! The package of sensors includes a so-called "penetrometer" to 
measure the impact deceleration (high for hard ground; lower for softer 
material), and equipment to determine all kinds of physical properties 
of the surface 145<br>

<br>
material, such as temperature, density, thermal conductivity, heat 
capacity and the local speed of sound. Huygens hits a relatively soft 
layer of material, possibly some kind of ice, and sinks partly before 
settling down completely. Later the measurements will be compared with 
laboratory results, collected during tests in which the penetrometer was
 dropped in different buckets filled with all kinds of materials. The 
analyses will show that the landing spot probably consisted of icy 
grains with the consistency of sand. 146<br>
<br>
 Instruments of Science Shortly after impacting the surface, the 
instruments measure an increase in methane gas. The heat of the active 
probe is warming up the ground, which apparently contains liquid methane
 that now evaporates. Pictures of the surface show a vast flat plane, 
covered with rounded blocks of ice (probably water-ice) that have been 
rounded by the wind and, maybe, liquid erosion. It is a desolate place, 
but still it looks somewhat familiar. However, this landscape has not 
been shaped by water and air, but by liquid methane and an alien 
atmosphere! The orange veil of Titan has finally been lifted. For at 
least another 2 hours Huygens continues to send images and measurements 
from the surface, but then Cassini loses sight of the little robotic 
explorer and decides to tum its large parabolic antenna back to Earth. 
Ground-based radio telescopes however continue to receive Huygens' 
signal until far beyond the expected lifetime of the batteries; they tum
 out to contain enough power to keep the probe alive on the surface for a
 total of 3.5 hours. At the ground control center the scientists and 
engineers are eagerly awaiting the first Huygens data transmitted by 
Cassini. The moment at which the signals are expected comes and passes. 
Has something gone wrong? Then, 6 minutes later than anticipated, the 
computer screens start to fill with long rows of numbers; the probe's 
invaluable scientific data is finally pouring in. However, not 
everything is well. Instead of two rows of data, only one is seen on the
 screens. As an insurance against failing equipment, Huygens sent its 
data via two separate transmitters working at different radio channels 
to Cassini. Now it appears that only one channel was received by the 
orbiter . Later the engineers find out that because of a command error 
Cassini was not tuned to receive the signals coming in on the other 
channel; Huygens was transmitting on two channels, but Cassini's 
receiver was only listening to one. The data of most instruments has 
been distributed over the two channels and so half of all they collected
 has still been received over the single working channel. The 
transmitting of the descent pictures has for instance been alternating 
between the two channels, so even though half of all the images are 
lost, the scientists are still able to assembly a complete series 
showing the whole descent. The most important data initially lost is 
that of the Doppler Wind Experiment, the data ofwhich was only sent over
 the channel that Cassini was not picking up. Fortunately a network 
ofradio telescopes on Earth has managed to receive some of Huygens' weak
 radio signals directly from Titan . Using data from large receiving 
dishes in Australia, China, Japan, 147<br>
<br>
 Chapter 5 the USA and Europe, the movements of the probe in the Titan 
atmosphere can later be puzzled together after all. The Doppler data has
 actually been found to be extremely good; even the swinging motion of 
the probe under its parachutes is detectable! The Huygens mission at 
Titan has only lasted for hours, but has given the scientist enough data
 to keep them busy for many years.<br>

<br>
HE launch is one of the most important moments in a space exploration 
project. It is a very short phase, as it takes roughly about 8 minutes 
to get into Earth orbit and only another couple of hours before the 
probe is boosted into interplanetary space. The launch signifies the 
moment when a project moves from designing, building and testing (when 
the spacecraft can still be touched) into the operations phase, where it
 is gone forever. At that moment the project is handed over by those who
 helped it to grow to those who operate it in space.<br>
<br>
ON THE ROAD The launch preparations start with the transport of the 
spacecraft from the safety of the assembly and testing facility to the 
launch site. Sometimes spacecraft travel by plane, sometimes by ship and
 almost always by truck for at least a part of the journey. The means of
 transportation may even need to be taken into account during the design
 of the spacecraft. It can involve shocks and load directions that are 
very different from what the space probe can normally expect during 
launch and operation. 149<br>
<br>
 Chapter 6 Engineers not familiar with the Russian launch base Baikonur 
are sometimes baffled by a strange spike showing up in the shock 
spectrum to which they have to design their spacecraft. It has nothing 
to do with the actual launch; it describes the shocks that may occur 
when the spacecraftis brought to the launch pad over a bumpy Russian 
railroad track. Spacecraft are not designed for the dusty, windy and 
sometimes wet atmosphere on Earth, the planet on which they were 
created. They may be able to stand extreme heat, cold, radiation and 
rough landings on distant planets, but a bit of rain or condensation can
 easily destroy their delicate equipment. They are therefore 
meticulously packed in hermetically sealed containers, equipped with 
their own independent air conditioning. At the launch site the 
containers are carefully opened inside a cleanroom. Some parts, such as 
antennas and solar arrays, may still need to be attached, and the whole 
spacecraft has to be checked one last time to ensure that it has 
survived transportation in mint condition.<br>
<br>
SPACEPORTS Interplanetary robots usually leave our planet from one of 
four major launch sites in the world. The best known are the Kennedy 
Space Center and the adjoining Cape Canaveral Air Force Base in Florida.
 Apart from the famous launch pads for the Space Shuttle , they include 
many more facilities for the launching of all kinds of civilian and 
military rockets. It is handy to launch your spacecraft from near the 
equator in an eastward direction, because it then gets the maximum speed
 benefit from the free velocity of the Earth's rotation (unless you want
 to launch a satellite to orbit over the Earth's poles). Spacecraft 
launched from close to the equator into lowly inclined orbits (i.e. at 
small angles with an imaginary line over the equator) get a free boost 
of 1,650 kilometers (1,030 miles) per hour. This saves an important 
amount of propellant, meaning that you can launch heavier spacecraft 
than elsewhere with the same launcher. At latitude 28.5 degrees north, 
Kennedy Space Center is relatively close to the equator. Moreover, the 
vast expanse of the Atlantic Ocean lies to the east, so that spent 
rocket stages (and failing rockets) can safely fall into the sea. Europe
 does not have an ocean to its east, only other relatively densely 150<br>
<br>
 Launch inhabited countries. As a result, launching interplanetary 
spacecraft from Europe is not safe. Luckily France has French Guiana, an
 overseas department in South America. A launch center for Europe's 
Ariane rockets was constructed at the edge of the jungle there, near the
 fishing village of Kourou. As it is located even closer to the equator 
than Kennedy Space Center, rockets launched from Kourou get an even 
bigger swing from the Earth's rotation . Moreover, Kourou also borders 
the Atlantic. Russia launches its interplanetary spacecraft from the 
vast area of Baikonur, also known as Tyuratam. In bygone years the 
Soviet Union was afraid that its primary launch base, including the 
nuclear rockets standing ready there, could be eliminated by a couple of
 US missiles if the pads were too close together. The cosmodrome 
therefore comprises about 50 launch pads that are spread out over an 
area greater than five times that of the city of Los Angeles. To find 
the Soviet ICBM (Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile) test site, US 
intelligence employed its secret U-2 spy planes. These long-winged 
planes could fly higher than any Soviet plane or anti-aircraft missile 
of the time. The Soviets tried to keep its enemies in the dark about the
 location of the launch base, but the U-2s started to follow major 
railroads in the hope that these would lead to the secret launch base. 
The idea was a success. In the summer of 1957, only weeks after the 
first Soviet ICBM test flight, a U-2 mission was able to shoot pictures 
of the R-7 rocket's launch pad in Tyuratam. Even though the West now 
knew where to find the cosmodrome, the Soviets continued to try to 
misinform their adversaries about the location . When they registered 
their first human spaceflight by cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin in 1961 as an 
official world record, they noted Baikonur as the launch site. In 
reality, Baikonur is a mining town 350 kilometers (218 miles) downrange 
from Tyuratam. Tyuratam is actually situated in Kazakhstan, which after 
the break-up of the Soviet Union became the independent Republic of 
Kazakhstan. As a result, the Russian base is now on foreign soil and the
 Russians have to pay rent to the Kazakhs to be able to continue their 
launches. Japan launches its spacecraft from its Kagoshima Space Center,
 situated on the most southern of the country's four main islands. 
Because large fleets of tuna fishers make their living in this area, 
launches are only permitted during a number of days in January, February
 and August. Apart from these launch bases, there are other existing 
sites where interplanetary spacecraft may start their voyages in the not
 too distant future. 151<br>
<br>
 Chapter 6 China has three major launch centers, but has not yet 
launched any spacecraft beyond Earth orbit. However , with the flight 
ofYang Liwei on board his spaceship Shenzhou 5, and the two "taikonauts"
 on board Shenzhou 6, China has recently become the third country that 
is able to launch its own astronauts. It will undoubtedly also want to 
organize its own interplanetary missions, and has expressed intentions 
to launch robotic spacecraft to the Moon in the near future. India has a
 launch base at Sriharikota Island in the southern state of Andhra 
Pradesh. The country has been launching satellites since 1980 and has 
announced plans to send a space probe to the Moon some time in the commg
 years. A very special type of launch base is operated by Sea Launch, a 
partnership of American, Norwegian, Russian and Ukrainian companies. 
Their launch facility is not at a fixed location on land, but consists 
of a floating, self-propelled launch platform and a separate assembly 
and command ship. As the launch platform - a modified oil rig - can be 
remotely controlled by the command ship's launch control center, no one 
needs to be on it during a launch. The command ship also houses a large 
assembly hall, where the Zenit-3SL rockets and payload are integrated 
before being transferred to the launch platform. This unique concept 
means that the whole "base" can be moved to an ideal location exactly on
 the equator. Moreover, in the empty middle of the ocean there are fewer
 safety, security and scheduling constrain ts. Sea Launch mainly targets
 the launch market for commercial communications satellites, and until 
now has not launched any interplanetary spacecraft. Spaceports do not 
only comprise rocket launch pads. They also include facilities for the 
preparation of the rockets and the spacecraft, and integration buildings
 for putting the spacecraft on top of the launchers. Then there are 
propellant production facilities, specifically for the extremely cold 
liquid oxygen and hydrogen "cryogenic" propellants. These fluids need to
 be cooled, respectively, to -184 and -251 degrees Celsius (-299 and 
-420 degrees Fahrenheit) to keep liquid. A little bit is always 
evaporating, and this "boil off" process makes it difficult to transport
 them . If the travel distance was too long, all the propellant would 
evaporate before it could be put into the launcher. Propellants for 
large solid propellant stages and boosters are also produced at the 
launch site, as it is much easierand saferto transport these items when 
they are empty. Non-cryogenic, storable liquid propellants such as 
kerosene are usually 152<br>
<br>
 Launch produced elsewhere, then transported to the launch site and 
stored near the launch pads. Launch sites also need mission control 
rooms for directing the launch and launch preparation activities, and a 
series of radar and optical tracking stations to monitor the rockets 
during flight.<br>
<br>
PREPARING FOR LAUNCH Planning of the launch campaign, i.e. everything 
directly related to the launch that has to be done before the spacecraft
 reaches orbit, is critical for the success of a mission. The launch 
preparations can take a long time; they have to be started at the right 
moment to ensure that the launcher will be ready for liftoff when needed
 . The right moment for launch is determined by the orbit and position 
of the target planet, the orbit of the Earth, the Earth's rotation and 
the trajectory needed for the probe to reach its destination. Clearly, 
this can easilybecome very complicated, and the right situation for 
launch may not occur very often or for the correct length of time. The 
available time period for launch, the so-called "launch window," can 
therefore be very small, and the interplanetary spacecraft has to be put
 on its way at a very precise moment. A launch at any other time would 
put the probe in a wrong orbit with respect to its target. For trips 
from Earth to Mars, the planets are in the right position for only a 
short period every 26 months. For example, the launch window can have a 
duration of only a few minutes each day over a total period of a week. 
Missing the right moment on a certain day is no disaster, as another 
possibility will normally be available the following day. However, 
missing all daily launch opportunities for the overall possible launch 
window, such as a week in this example, means that the probe is no 
longer able to reach its target. The movements of the planets do not 
wait for us. Sometimes there may be no new series of launch 
opportunities for years, and perhaps never. This last situation occurred
 with ESA's comet probe Rosetta, which missed its proper launch window 
because there were serious problems with the type ofAriane 5 rocket that
 was supposed to launch it (the Ariane launched just before Rosetta 
failed to reach orbit because ofa design error in its new main engine). 
By the time the rocket system was back in operation, Rosetta could no 
longer reach its original target comet and a new comet in a suitable 
orbit had to be (and was) found. 153<br>
<br>
 Chapter 6 The pre-flight operations for a spacecraft launcher begin 
with transporting all its elements to the launch base. For an Ariane 5 
launch campaign in French Guiana, the rocket stages are brought over sea
 from Europe in one of two special transport ships, the Toucan or the 
Colibri. The trip takes 12 days. After unloading at the Pariacabo dock 
up a sea inlet leading to the launch base, the stages are transported by
 road to the nearby spaceport. The Ariane 5 main stage, upper stage and 
the vehicle equipment bay with all the guidance, navigation and 
communication equipment are transferred to the Launcher Integration 
Building. The aerodynamic fairing, which protects the spacecraft before 
and during launch, is brought to the Final Assembly Building. Inside the
 58-meter-high (190-foot-high) Launcher Integration Building, the main 
stage is pulled up by a big crane and placed vertically on a mobile 
launch table. The two huge solid propellant boosters, having been filled
 with solid propellant in the Booster Preparation Building, also arrive 
in the integration building and are vertically docked to the main stage,
 one on each side. Next, the vehicle equipment bay and the upper stage 
are mounted on top of the main stage. The nearly complete Ariane 5 is 
then checked to ensure that all elements have been connected securely 
and that all electrical connections are working. Sixteen days later the 
doors of the Launcher Integration Building are opened and the rocket on 
its launch table is moved along its rail track to the Final Assembly 
Building, were it will be mated with its payload. In the meantime the 
spacecraft in its storage container has arrived by plane at Rochambeau 
Airport in Cayenne, and driven to the Satellite Preparation Facilities 
of the base. Here the space probe is unpacked inside one of the 
cleanrooms, separately shipped items such as solar arrays and large 
antennas are installed and the whole thing is checked to make sure that 
everything is in working order. Most spacecraft have their own 
propulsion subsystem, which means that their tanks need to be filled 
before launch. As spacecraft propellant is often dangerously toxic, this
 takes a lot of preparation and needs to be done with great care. 
Engineers responsible for filling the tanks need to wear special 
protection suits with helmets and supply lines that provide air from 
outside the cleanroom. It makes them look like astronauts. Mter filling,
 the spacecraft tanks are put under pressure and the system is checked 
for leakages. 154<br>
<br>
 Launch The spacecraft is then mounted on a Payload Adapter, which 
functions as the interface with the launcher. The Payload Adapter 
includes the mechanisms that will free the spacecraft from the launcher 
when it has arrived in orbit. Once all this has been done the spacecraft
 is also transferred to the Final Assembly Building. At the 
90-meter-high (300-foot-high) Final Assembly Building the spacecraft on 
its Payload Adapter is hoisted on top of the Ariane 5 upper stage. 
Finally, the Payload Fairing is put over the spacecraft to structurally 
complete the launcher. The next step is to fill the upper stage and the 
rocket's altitude control systems with non-cryogenic propellant and to 
perform further checks on the entire combination. Operations in the 
Final Assembly Building last about 14 days, after which the Ariane 5 
with its payload is rolled out to the launch pad on rails, pulled by a 
powerful truck . The mobile launch table is then connected to the launch
 pad, propellant lines are hooked up to the main stage and electrical 
connections are made with the launcher and the spacecraft. The final 
countdown then begins. Shortly before launch the tanks of the Ariane 5 
main stage are filled with liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. Because 
these extremely cold fluids boil off rather quickly and are dangerous to
 work with, this cannot be done earlier. In the meantime, the launcher 
subsystems are checked and the computer program with the flight data for
 the automatic guidance system is loaded into the launcher's computer. 
The launch teams get ready in the control center and various tracking 
facilities. Before launch , people have to be cleared from the area 
around the launch pad and airspace through which the vehicle will 
travel. Rocket launches are sometimes delayed because tourists come 
dangerously close in sports planes or boats. Dropped rocket stages or 
debris from an explosion could kill anyone who is too near the launch 
pad or is directly under the trajectory of the rocket. At 6 minutes 30 
seconds before liftoff, the countdown becomes automatic . The rocket 
itself is now working on its own, with all further actions being timed 
by its internal clock. From then on, apart from stopping the whole 
launch procedure, the people at the base can only watch and hope for the
 best.<br>
<br>
155<br>
<br>
 Chapter 6<br>
<br>
UP AND AWAY The time for checking and adjusting is over. As the 
spacecraft sits on top of its launcher moments before liftoff, the minds
 of all those involved in its creation are spooked by nightmares of 
explosions, unknown mistakes that may have slipped by, critical issues 
that might have needed just a little more study. Soon years and years of
 work will be hurtling into space on top of hundreds of tons of burning 
explosives. Launching spacecraft is still not routine, even though we 
have now been doing it for nearly 50 years. The pressures in the rocket 
engines, the velocities and the forces involved are tremendous, and yet 
rockets cannot be over-designed very much because that would make them 
too heavy to carry a reasonable mass into orbit. The margins for error 
are therefore rather low. On average, about two or three out ofa hundred
 launches fail. This is an extremely high failure rate when compared to 
airplanes, for instance, where crashes are measured in numbers per 
millions of flights. One minute before liftoff the electrical power 
supply from the launch pad is cut off and the rocket becomes autonomous,
 drawing power from its internal batteries. The countdown proceeds in 
French " ... 3, 2, 1, Top." Hydrogen and oxygen pour into the combustion
 chamber of the main stage's single Vulcain engine and are ignited. The 
hot gasses reach a temperature of 1,500 degrees Celsius (2,730 degrees 
Fahrenheit) and spew out ofthe nozzle, giving the launcher 115 metric 
tons (255,000 pounds) of thrust . However, this is not enough to push 
the 745-metric-ton (1.64million-pound) Ariane 5 off the ground. For just
 over 7 seconds the launcher remains on the pad to check whether the 
Vulcain engine works properly. Then the two powerful, 30-meter-high 
(98-foot-high) boosters are ignited and begin to deliver most of the 
thrust needed to take off Once these unstoppable solid propellant rocket
 motors have been started it is no longer possible to prevent the Ariane
 5 from leaving the pad. The combined thrust ofthe main engine and the 
two boosters at liftoffis about 1,200 metric tons (2.65 million pounds),
 the equivalent of the thrust produced by 11 Boeing 747 aircraft. 
Majestically and with a thunderous roar the rocket climbs straight up 
and clears the launch tower. A set of small engines in the upper part of
 the rocket is used to roll the Ariane around its axis and correct its 
orientation . The big nozzles of the two boosters and smaller one of the
 Vulcain engine swivel to steer the launcher onto the right trajectory. 
Soaring into the tropical sky the Ariane 5 heads east over the ocean.

 Chapter 6 About 130 seconds after liftoff the rocket has already 
reached an altitude of 55 kilometers (34 miles). At that moment the two 
boosters have each spent their 238 metric tons (525,000 pounds) of solid
 propellant and become dead weight. Pyrotechnic devices free them from 
the rest of the launcher and separation rockets ignite to push the 
nearly empty steel cylinders away. The now much lighter Ariane 5 
continues its journey into space on the thrust of its Vulcain engine. 
The spent boosters fly on for about 100 kilometers (62 miles) and then ,
 some 450 kilometers (280 miles) from the launch site, fall into the 
Atlantic Ocean. Although the boosters can be recovered by ships for 
technical investigation, unlike the similar but larger boosters of the 
Space Shuttle , they are not reused. For Ariane 5 it was found to be 
less expensive to build new ones than to disassemble, clean, repair and 
reassemble old ones. During flight through the atmosphere the payload 
fairing protects the precious spacecraft cargo against the pressure and 
heat of the compressed air flowing over the nose of the rocket. Inside, 
the fairing has a layer of acoustic absorption panels, to dampen the 
acoustic violence of the boosters from damaging the spacecraft. Some 3 
minutes into the flight, at an altitude of about 100 kilometers (62 
miles), the Ariane 5 has left nearly all of the atmosphere behind. There
 is no longer a need for the more than 2-metric-ton (4,000-pound) heavy 
fairing, and it is jettisoned. Two pyrotechnic systems are used to 
remove the fairing. Detonating the horizontal system ruptures the 
connection with the Ariane 5's upper part. The vertical separation 
system splits the fairing in two halves when it separates from the 
launcher. Seven minutes later the first, main rocket stage runs empty 
and is jettisoned. The onboard computer ignites the second stage and the
 flight goes on with a much smaller configuration. Only the upper rocket
 stage, the Vehicle Equipment Bay and the spacecraft payload continue 
the ascent. About half an hour after liftoff, depending on the target 
orbit , the spacecraft is finally released from what is left of the 
Ariane 5. The spacecraft is then on its own. The launch phase is now 
over, and a hectic period starts for the people in the spacecraft 
control and operations center. They have to send the commands to deploy 
the solar arrays and antennas, and make sure that the probe is correctly
 oriented to enable them to communicate with it. Next, the operations 
team has quickly to check that the space probe is fine and in the right 
orbit . This is the first time the spacecraft is really in 158<br>
<br>
 Launch space, and some simulations and tests done on Earth may prove to
 have been slightly inaccurate. Parts of the probe may get warmer than 
predicted, which can be helped by reorienting the spacecraft to provide 
more shadow for the overheated parts. Some equipment may not have 
survived the launch 100 percent. This can be tested by looking at the 
telemetry data sent by the spacecraft and manual test operations of the 
troubled elements. The operations team may decide to switch over to 
backup equipment if the impact of malfunctions is serious, or adjust the
 mission plan to work around the problems. New software with routine 
flight command sequences may be uploaded to replace onboard software 
that was only used just after launch. The programming of the onboard 
computer may need to be adapted to the differences between the real 
flight in space and what was foreseen before launch . Once all equipment
 has been checked out , all immediate problems have been solved and the 
spacecraft has been put into a stable situation, routine flight 
operations begin.<br>
<br>
ROCKETS Most interplanetary space probes get launched on expendable 
"throw away" rockets. When the spacecraft is in orbit, nothing of these 
huge, expensive machines is left for reuse on other missions. The empty 
stages of these machines are dropped off along the way to get rid of 
dead weight, splashing into the ocean or burning up in the atmosphere . 
The only partly reusable system ever employed for putting interplanetary
 spacecraft on their way is the Space Shuttle. The Space Shuttle , or 
Space Transportation System as it is formally named, consists of the 
Orbiter, a large External Tank and two enormous Solid Rocket Boosters. 
The Shuttle Orbiter is the famous stubby plane in which the astronauts 
are launched and live while in orbit. It returns astronauts and material
 to Earth and is completely reusable, although an enormous effort is 
needed to refurbish the vehicle after each flight. The External Tank is 
the large brown cylinder that carries most of the propellant for the 
three large rocket motors on the Shuttle Orbiter. The tank stays 
attached to the Orbiter for almost the entire ascent, but is discarded 
just before entering orbit. It falls back to Earth and burns up in the 
atmosphere because of its high velocity, which compresses the air 159<br>

 Launch resulting in extremely high temperatures (the effect is similar 
to a pump heating up when you inflate the tires of a bicycle, due to the
 compression of the air inside). The two Solid Rocket Boosters attached 
to the External Tank are similar to those on Ariane 5, but much larger. 
They provide most of the thrust during the first 2 minutes ofthe Space 
Shuttle's flight. After burning out, they are ejected. However, unlike 
the External Tank they are not lost but are retrieved from the ocean 
after a slow descent by parachute. After a major refurbishment effort, 
they are reused and are later reloaded with new solid rocket propellant.
 The reason that expendable rockets are still used more than reusable 
systems like the Space Shuttle, is that they are much less expensive to 
develop and much easier to operate. In fact, the maintenance of the 
Space Shuttle is so costly that, for the relatively few times per year 
that a satellite needs to be launched, it is cheaper to build and use an
 expendable, oneshot rocket. Expendable launchers are inherently 
expensive in use: a medium sized launcher such as the Russian Soyuz 
Fregat can put a T, 100-kilogram (2,400-pound) spacecraft such as Mars 
Express on its way, but to do so it bums some 289 metric tons (640,000 
pounds) of propellant and throws away 26 metric tons (57,000 pounds) of 
precious rocket hardware. A Soyuz Fregat launch is relatively cheap in 
comparison to European and US rockets, costing in the order of $40 
million. A US Delta II 7925 rocket can launch a 725-kilogram 
(1,598-pound) spacecraft such as Mars Odyssey out of Earth orbit for 
about $60 million. The Atlas V-401 that launched the 2,180-kilogram 
(4,810-pound) Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in August 2005 has a price tag
 of about $90 million. An Ariane 5 launch ofan even heavier space probe 
of3,000 kilograms (6,600 pounds) such as the comet explorer Rosetta, 
costs over $150 million. However, before the Columbia disaster, a Space 
Shuttle launch with all its complicated pre-launch activities and human 
spaceflight equipment for the astronauts was costing in the order of 
$300 to $500 million per flight. The additional safety constraints now 
put in place probably put the current costs well above halfa billion. 
For launching spacecraft beyond a low Earth orbit it even needs an 
additional, and costly, expendable rocket stage. Until we learn how to 
build and maintain efficient, cost-effective reusable launchers and have
 a need to fly them very often so that the average launch price drops 
dramatically, most interplanetary probes will continue to be launched 
with old-fashioned but effective expendable rockets. New versions of the
 Ariane, Atlas, Delta and Soyuz rockets are still being developed, and 
it doesn't look as if they will become obsolete very soon . 161<br>

 Chapter 6<br>
<br>
ORBITS Do you remember the earlier explanation about how a large gun on 
top of an extremely high tower could theoretically put an object into 
orbit? At the right speed a satellite will not fall back down, but will 
continuously circle the Earth . At a higher velocity of about 12 
kilometers (7.5 miles) per hour, the Earth's gravity will even lose its 
grip and the spacecraft will be able to break out oforbit and escape 
into outer space. At that point it becomes a satellite of the Sun, just 
like the planets. If the spacecraft's orbit is highly elliptical and 
therefore crosses the more or less circular orbits of the planets, it 
may possibly be able to travel to other worlds. Moving from Earth to 
another planet is very different from flying from one city to another. 
Cities don't move and, moreover, are always located on the surface of 
the Earth. That makes finding your way a relatively simple 
two-dimensional problem, and a flat map is sufficient for navigation. 
However, planets are constantly in motion with reference to everything 
else; they circle the Sun at different speeds and seldom exactly in the 
same plane. Moreover, once a space probe is on its way, Newton is in the
 driving seat. The orbital mechanics that he, for the first time, 
described mathematically make the probe follow a curved, elliptical 
trajectory. This orbit can be changed only slightly because the amount 
ofrocket propellant available is limited . So, before leaving Earth we 
have to make sure that the target planet is at the right location when 
our spacecraft crosses its orbit. The departure time or "launch window" 
is determined by this. We also need to configure our trajectory in such a
 way that the probe will rendezvous with the planet at the right speed -
 not too fast if we want to go in orbit around it, and not too slow if 
we only want to fly by and continue our journey. Aiming straight at the 
planet all the way is not a good idea if you don't want to crash into 
its surface. The most energy efficient way of traveling from one planet 
to another the one that requires the lowest speed and therefore the 
least amount of propellant - is called a Hohmann transfer. In a Hohmann 
transfer, a spacecraft follows an elliptical orbit that just touches 
both the orbit of the Earth and that of the target planet. To reach a 
planet further from the Sun, the probe will depart Earth at the point on
 its elliptical Hohmann transfer orbit that is closest to the Sun (known
 as the "perihelion"), and will meet the target planet at the transfer

orbit's furthest point (known as the "aphelion"). To reach planets 
closer to the Sun, the process is reversed. The spacecraftwill thus 
travel exactly half of an ellipse to get to its target. For a flight to 
Mercury for instance, a probe launched from Earth starts at the aphelion
 of its Hohmann trajectory. To change its orbit so that its perihelion 
gets closer to the Sun and touches the orbit of Mercury, the probe needs
 to decrease its orbital energy. It does that by accelerating opposite 
to the direction of the Earth's motion around the Sun. It effectively 
brakes and thereby "falls" toward the Sun. To get to Mars, a spacecraft 
departs at perihelion, and thus has to increase its orbital energy by 
accelerating in the direction of the Earth's motion. That will make its 
aphelion equal to the distance of Mars's orbit. For flying to Mars, the 
best launch position is some months before Earth is about to overtake 
Mars on the "inside track" in their concentric orbits around the Sun. 
This ensures that by the time the spacecraft 163<br>
<br>
 Chapter 6 arrives at the orbit of Mars, the red planet will also be at 
that point in its orbit. When the probe has reached its destination, it 
may also have to brake to get into an orbit around it, depending on the 
velocity ofthe planet and the speed at which the spacecraft reached it. 
Once there, the orbit around the planet can be adjusted by using the 
onboard rocket engines. Braking has the effect of lowering the orbit's 
altitude ; accelerating will make the orbit higher . In this wayan 
initially highly elliptical orbit can also be made more circular, which 
is often preferred for planet observation missions. (However, a fully 
circular orbit is seldom achieved, because that would require too much 
propellant.) The recent Mars orbiters Mars Global Surveyor and Mars 
Odyssey have used "aerobraking" to slow down. This technique consists of
 carefully calculated dips into the upper layers of the Martian 
atmosphere, using the aerodynamic drag to gradually adjust the orbit. 
Before arrival, you have to choose the angle at which you want the orbit
 to intersect the planet's equator, i.e. the orbit inclination. You can 
make the spacecraft fly over the planet's poles, for instance. Polar 
orbits are very handy, because it enables the spacecraft to observe the 
entire planet while it slowly revolves under the probe's orbit . The 
inclination can also be altered once in orbit around the planet, but 
that will use a lot ofpropellant (and carrying too much propellant may 
make a spacecraft too heavy for its designated launcher) . Therefore, 
being left behind on Earth , how do we keep track ofwhere an 
interplanetary spacecraft is and how fast it is moving? This is 
important, as along the way we will need to fine-tune the navigation and
 observation commands for the spacecraftwhen, for example, it needs to 
know when to fire its rocket engine and where to point its instruments. 
The direction of the probe is easy to establish: it is where its radio 
signals are coming from . But to find out how far away it is requires 
some special measures. To range the distance from Earth, we can place 
specially coded signals (called ranging tones) on the radio messages 
sent to the spacecraft. When they are received by the probe, it 
immediately puts them on its returning radio signal. By noting exactly 
the times at which the ranging tones left Earth and when they were 
received, and taking into account the speed of the signals (the speed 
oflight), the round-trip distance can be computed. In reality it is not 
as simple as that, of course. For really accurate measurements, we also 
need to know how long it took the ranging tones to "turn around" inside 
the spacecraft's electronics. Similarly, we should know how long it took
 the signals to get from the ground control 164<br>
<br>
 Launch computer to the transmitting ground station antenna. We also 
need to know how far the Earth moved while the ranging pulses were 
traveling to the spacecraft. The minute delay within the spacecraft's 
communications equipment can be measured during pre-launch testing, as 
can the delays in the ground equipment. We can compute the movement of 
the Earth from detailed astronomical observations. Taking all this into 
account, we are currently able to measure the distance to a spacecraft 
far out in the Solar System within an accuracy of a few meters! The 
velocity of the spacecraft can be determined by measuring the Doppler 
frequency shift in the radio signals it transmits, as described 
previously for Messenger and Huygens. Once the spacecraft arrives near 
its target, we can also use the background stars on the pictures it 
sends to determine its position and velocity. It works similarly to how,
 on the old sailing ships, people determined their position by celestial
 observation. This so-called "optical navigation" can even give a more 
precise analysis of the spacecraft's trajectory than ranging and the 
Doppler effect alone.<br>

N this chapter we will have a look at how the diversity ofrobotic space 
probe missions - and, with them, our knowledge of the Solar System - 
have dramatically expanded over the last 20 years or so. Each mission 
targeting a planet, moon, comet or asteroid presented us with its own 
challenges. Each of them also rewarded humanity with unique scientific 
rewards when successfully completed. Learning by trial and error, and 
often not solely driven by curiosity but also significantly by political
 and industrial competition, humans probed further and further into the 
Solar System - most often not in person , but by virtual presence with 
robotic explorers. The history of space exploration is a bit like a 
video game: only when you have mastered the tricks required to complete a
 certain level can you go to the next, and each subsequent level 
presents you with new , even more demanding challenges. If you fail to 
reach the end of a level, you have to repeat it all over again unless 
you have more than one "life" (in our case, a backup spacecraft). After 
we managed to put a satellite into Earth orbit, the next obvious 167<br>
<br>
 Chapter 7 step was to reach our own Moon - a very convenient target for
 learning the trades of robotic exploration without going to far from 
home. As the Moon is in an orbit around the Earth, it is continuously 
accessibleand can always be found in an easily predictable location. The
 Moon is nearby, so it can be reached in only a matter of days. All this
 makes it possible for successive probes, each one improved on the basis
 ofprevious missions, to be launched to the Moon one after another with 
little time in between. As conditions near the Moon are similar to those
 in Earth orbit, lunar orbiters could initially be very similar to 
Earth-orbiting satellites (in fact, the Moon is itself an Earth-orbiting
 satellite). Furthermore, the Moon has no atmosphere, so clean, sharp 
observations from orbit are relatively easy. Also, landing on the Moon 
is not too difficult, owing to the low gravity (only one-sixth ofthe 
gravity on Earth), lack ofwind and weather, and the fact that on a small
 scale the lunar surface is rather smooth. There are not too many large 
rocks or steep crater walls that could make a lander topple over. As the
 Moon always shows the same side to us, it was easy to stay in contact 
with probe s landing on its nearside. Also, its proximity results in 
small communication delays between ground stations and lunar spacecraft 
of only a few seconds. The next planetary destinations, Venus and Mars, 
presented an entirely new range ofcomplex challenges. As each of these 
planets follows its own elliptical orbit around the Sun, independent of 
the Earth, probes sent to investigate them need to be launched within 
very specific timeframes. The distance to these planets means that, seen
 from the Earth, they present a much smaller target in space than the 
Moon. They are thus more likely to be missed if our orbital calculations
 are not precise enough. The problems increase for the planets beyond 
Mars or closer to the Sun than Venus. If the Sun were the size of a 
grapefruit, Earth would be the size of a grain of sand orbiting at a 
distance of 10.5 meters (34 feet). Venus would be another grain of sand 
orbiting closer to the Sun at 70 percent the SunEarth distance, and Mars
 would be an even smaller particle going around at a distance of 16 
meters (52 feet). The next planet, giant Jupiter, would be a small 
marble at 54.5 meters (178 feet) and the outermost of the original nine 
large planets, Pluto , a speck of dust as far off as 414 meters (1,359 
feet) from the Sun. Try to imagine our microscopically tiny space probes
 traveling between these small objects, all within an area the size of a
 large parking lot. Looking at it in this way, it seems a miracle that 
we are ever able to rendezvous with any planet at all! 168<br>

For spacecraft, life is easier near Earth (and this is also true for 
living organisms). The further away from it, the more difficult it gets.

or Moon, it is much colder and there is less light for solar arrays to 
convert into electrical power. Going near Venus, which is much closer to
 the Sun, spacecraft run the risk of overheating. Conditions near 
Mercury, even 169<br>
<br>
 Chapter 7 closer to the Sun than Venus, are extremely hot and radiation
 levels are lethal. Nevertheless, as the next paragraphs will show, our 
sturdy robotic science explorers have now ventured nearly throughout the
 entire Solar System.<br>
<br>
TO THE MOON The Moon orbits quite close to us, on average at a distance 
of only 384,000 kilometers (239,000 miles). For centuries its surface 
has been studied through increasingly large and powerful telescopes. 
Nevertheless, until we were able to send spacecraft to inspect it, we 
knew very little about our neighbor in space. Stuck on Earth, 
astronomers could see that the Moon was quite barren and had no visible 
vegetation or water on its surface. The areas that were named "seas" and
 "oceans" in classical times were actually found to be dark, relatively 
smooth plains of solidified lava. Nor did it seem to have an atmosphere 
of any appreciable thickness as the horizon can always be clearly seen; 
the border between the sunlit side and the night side always appeared 
sharp and direct; and no clouds were ever observed to drift over the 
lunar surface. Moreover, the surface never seemed to be disturbed by 
wind, weather or anything else. We could see lots of craters, small and 
large, but it was not clear whether they were volcanic in nature or the 
result of a heavy meteorite bombardment. There were also lots of 
mountains and winding valleys.<br>
<br>
The first visits In January 1959 Earth sent its first envoy to another 
world. The Soviet Luna 1 was intended to hit the Moon, but due to the 
primitive guidance methods of the time the probe actually flew past it, 
missing its target by just under 6,000 kilometers (3,700 miles). 
Typically, the Soviets claimed that they had intended to zoom past the 
Moon. Nevertheless, it was a great achievement; never before had 
humanity gotten so close to another world. With Luna 2, following 
shortly in September of the same year, the Soviets managed to hit the 
lunar surface and thus placed, or rather smacked, the first man-made 
object on the Moon. 170<br>

<br>
Luna 3, launched a month later, went around the Moon and showed us, for 
the first time, images of the lunar farside. Not surprisingly, it proved
 to be as inhospitable as the nearside that is always facing Earth, but 
there were fewer dark "seas" to be seen. Although spacecraft imaging 
techniques were still crude and the pictures therefore rather vague and 
blurry, the Luna 3 images nevertheless satisfied the curiosity ofa 
Frenchman who had promised a crate ofthe best Champagne to whoever would
 show him the back of the Moon. New Year found the Russian Luna 3 
technicians enjoying some well-deserved bottles. In the meantime the USA
 had only managed to react with a single, more or less successful, Moon 
probe, Pioneer 4, in March 1959. It didn't 171<br>
<br>
 Chapter 7 go into lunar orbit, it didn't get closer than about 60,000 
kilometers (37,000 miles) to the Moon, and it didn't even carry a 
camera. That was clearly no match for the string of Soviet spectaculars.
 America was also behind in human space missions. The Soviets had been 
the first to send a man into Earth orbit, the first to send a woman in 
space, and the first to make a spacewalk outside the relative safety of a
 spaceship. This prompted president Kennedy to make his historic 
announcement in May 1961 to land a man on the Moon before the end of the
 decade. In his famous speech to Congress, he called the space race a 
battle between freedom and tyranny. The old Moon had become the subject 
of an ideological and technical race. For billions ofyears it had looked
 down on the Earth and recently watched mankind taking over the Earth. 
Now it was to become part of human evolution itself<br>
<br>
Preparing for Apollo If it was to land people on the Moon and start 
developing the necessary spacecraft, America very quickly needed to 
discover what to expect on the lunar surface. Before Kennedy's 
announcement, NASA had decided to launch a series of kamikaze space 
probes to crash on the Moon and make detailed pictures of the surface 
while going down. Success with these Ranger missions would not come 
easy, however. The Moon does not orbit in the same plane as the Earth's 
equator. Because of the 23.5-degree tilt of the Earth's axis with 
respect to the plane of its orbit, and the fact that the Moon's orbit is
 inclined by about 5 degrees to the plane of the Earth's orbit, the 
Moon's orbit may be inclined up to 28.6 degrees to the Earth's equator. 
Because of this, the ideal moment to launch a probe to the Moon only 
occurs once every two weeks, approximately. It is, ofcourse, rather 
easyto miss this launch appointment, for instance due to a problem with 
the rocket or because of bad weather. To create more opportunities, i.e.
 to widen the launch window, a spacecraft can first be launched into a 
so-called parking orbit - a low orbit around the Earth that is parallel 
to that of the Moon. There, the probe simply orbits around until it is 
in the right position to continue its journey to the Moon. It will meet 
this position once on every orbit, about every 90 minutes, which is much
 better than the twice-permonth launch window back on Earth! When the 
right moment arrives, a further boost by the last stage of the launcher 
will put the probe on its way. The Ranger spacecraft also followed this 
parking orbit method . The 172<br>
<br>
 Distant Destinations first two were initially launched successfully, 
but once in low Earth orbit the rocket stage that was to send them on 
their way to the Moon malfunctioned. The third Ranger experienced 
guidance errors that sent it flying far past the Moon, missing it by 
37,000 kilometers (23,000 miles). Ranger 4 actually managed to hit the 
lunar surface, but almost nothing on the probe worked and no useful data
 was returned. Ranger 5's solar panels shorted out about 75 minutes into
 the mission, and with depleted batteries and thus completely inactive 
it flew past the Moon uselessly at a distance of 720 kilometers (450 
miles). Confronted with the humiliating series of failures, NASA decided
 to severely simplify the over-engineered design used for the Rangers up
 to that point. All payload instruments not strictly necessary were 
removed, and only the essential battery of six cameras remained (two 
cameras, a wide-angle and a narrow-angle imager, looked down at the 
entire surface under the probe, while the other four each covered a 
quarter of the view). The first of the new breed, Ranger 6, was launched
 in January 1964. Initially going the wrong way, NASA operators managed 
to have the probe make a successful course correction that aimed it 
straight for the Moon. With only some 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) to 
go, the command was sent to tum on the cameras. Nothing happened. Ranger
 6 fell to its doom without returning a single image. Success was 
finally achieved on July 31, 1964, when Ranger 7 came dashing down to 
the lunar surface with its cameras taking in a view never seen before. 
The pictures sent back to Earth revealed details down to 1 meter (3 
feet) in diameter. This was a thousand times better than had ever been 
achieved with a telescope on Earth. More than six months later, in 
February '1965, Ranger 8 was launched and returned more pictures of the 
Moon. Encouraged by the successes, NASA decided to broadcast the 
pictures ofRanger 9 live over television as it approached the surface in
 March 1965. Viewers of all major US television channels watched the 
view of the crater Alphonsus grow bigger and bigger on their screens, 
until the probe hit the surface. Mass media had reached the Moon. In the
 meantime it was the tum of the Soviets to cope with failure after 
failure . None of their lunar probes launched after Luna 3 had delivered
 anything useful; the only partial success was Luna 4, which got into 
the wrong lunar orbit and only delivered some measurements on the solar 
wind and cosmic radiation. (Luna probes attaining Earth orbit but 
failing to reach the Moon were officially listed as Cosmos satellites to
 hide their failure; Soviet launches that did not even make it into 
orbit were not disclosed.) 173<br>
<br>
 Chapter 7 After hard-impact kamikaze missions, the next step was to 
touch down softly, to have a better look at the lunar surface and to 
prove that it could be done. This meant that probes had to be equipped 
with rocket-braking systems capable of bringing down the velocity to 
virtually zero just before touching the surface (without an atmosphere, 
parachutes could not be used). The first four of a new series of Soviet 
soft-landing Luna explorers crashed on the Moon (Lunas 5, 7 and 8) or 
missed it entirely (Luna 6), but Luna 9 was a big success. On February 
3, 1966, it sent back three panoramic black and white pictures from the 
lunar surface. A British radio astronomer managed to pick up the 
non-encoded television signals sent to Earth by the Luna, and to the 
annoyance of the Soviets the pictures appeared in a British newspaper 
before they had the chance to officially present them to the world. The 
pictures showed that the Luna 9 landing site in the Ocean of Storms was a
 dusty, rather flat area covered with rough rocks of all sizes. Most 
importantly, the surface proved to be able to support a heavy 
spacecraft; before the landing some scientists had predicted that 
anything or anyone attempting to land on the Moon would sink and 
disappear in meters of lunar dust . Luna 10 was not supposed to land, 
but to become the first ever satellite in a stable orbit around the 
Moon. It did this very successfully and thus proved that it could be 
done. It also measured the amount of radiation emitted by radioactive 
materials on the Moon, and showed this to be far below danger levels for
 future human explorers. Soon after the USA also managed to land gently 
on the Moon with its Surveyor spacecraft. More sophisticated than Luna 
9, they not only made pictures of the surface, but also scooped up 
samples to test the thickness and consistency of the gray dust covering 
the surface. Of the seven Surveyors launched between May 1966 and 
January 1968, only the second and fourth were unsuccessful. In the 
meantime the USA also put five Lunar Orbiter spacecraft in orbits around
 the Moon, between August 1966 and August 1968. These mapped almost the 
entire lunar surface to find the best landing sites for the future 
Apollo crewed moon missions. Lunar Orbiter 1 also made the first 
pictures of the Earth as seen from the Moon. Now everything was set to 
send crewmembers. The Soviets managed to make the first return flight to
 the Moon and back with their unmanned Zond 5 spacecraft in September 
1968. Zond 5 even carried a "crew" of plants, seeds, insects and 
tortoises. However, only three months later America put the crew 
ofApollo 8 in orbit around the Moon and returned them safely back to 
Earth. 174<br>
<br>
 Distant Destinations Two more Apollo test flights followed, and on July
 20, 1969, Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became 
the first people to walk on the surface of the Moon. The Soviet crewed 
program was by that time in complete disarray; there were problems 
making their spacecraft work and during each test flight the giant N-l 
moonrocket blew up shortly after leaving the launch pad. In a last act 
of desperation, during the Apollo 11 mission the Soviets tried to send 
their Luna 15 lander to the Moon and have it return with a few surface 
samples. The last chance to steal away some of the glory from the 
American Apollo program died with Luna is's crash on the lunar surface. 
Later, in September 1970, Luna 16 managed to launch back a handful of 
lunar dust to Earth, but by then the Apollo astronauts had already 
returned bags full of soil and rocks. Robot rovers<br>
<br>
America went on with its crewed lunar missions with Apollos 12 to 17, 
then left the Moon alone for over 20 years. The Moon Race had been won, 
and the American people and their politicians had lost interest. NASA 
now focused on the development and operation of the Space Shuttle and a 
large space station (which eventually became the International Space 
Station currently in orbit). The Soviets, however, continued with their 
robotic lunar missions, partly to show that they did not need expensive 
crewed landings to do science on the Moon. (Their entire failed crewed 
Moon program was not divulged until the collapse of the Soviet Union, 
although CIA spy satellites had kept the US military up to date on the 
N-1 moonrocket launch attempts.) In November 1970 they landed Luna 17, 
carrying the Lunokhod 1, a robotic vehicle the size of a golf cart that 
was remotely controlled from Earth. It had eight wheels with electric 
motors and was steered by rotating the wheels on each side at different 
speeds (much like a tank on Earth). A hinged cover with solar cells was 
opened during the day to provide electrical power, and closed at night 
to keep the machine warm. It came down on a separate landing module , 
equipped with extendable ramps to enable the vehicle to drive off onto 
the surface. For 11 months Lunokhod 1 strolled over the lonely surface, 
making 20,000 pictures. In 1973 it was followed by Lunokhod 2. Although 
less spectacular than the crewed Apollo missions, the Lunokhods proved 
the technology for a new breed of robotic space explorer: the planetary 
rover. 175<br>

The last Russian lunar mission of the twentieth century landed on the 
Moon on August 18, 1976. Luna 24 drilled 2 meters into the lunar soil 
and returned these valuable samples to scientists on Earth a few days 
later. Modem missions<br>
<br>
After the massive assaults ofthe 1960s and early 1970s it was 
fairlyquiet on the Moon. In 1990, while on its way to Jupiter, the 
Galileo orbiter made the first good pictures of the Moon's south pole. 
However, in 1994 the Moon received some further attention when in 
February of that year Clementine arrived to orbit around it. Clementine 
was a joint project of NASA and the US Department of Defense. It was 
designed to investigate the Moon using sensor technology that would also
 be useful for new military satellites such as those of the SDI "Star 
Wars" rocket shield project. The probe was built in record time and by a
 small team at relatively little cost. For the first time ever, 
Clementine mapped the entire Moon in visible light, ultraviolet and 
infrared. It made a spectacular discovery when it beamed radar signals 
into the dark craters ofthe lunar south pole: the radio 176<br>
<br>
 Distant Destinations beams bounced back with twice the normal 
signalstrength for the Moon's surface. Such high reflectivity suggested 
the presence of ice in these deep craters that are in permanent shadow 
from the warmth of the Sun! Maybe this ice, if it was really there, had 
accumulated by impacts of comets consisting of water-ice, never 
evaporating because of the eternal low temperatures deep inside the 
south pole craters. These and other intriguing questions triggered a new
 NASA mission that was launched in 1998: Lunar Prospector. Lunar 
Prospector did not have a camera on board, as it would not be able to 
see anything inside the dark craters in any case. Instead, it carried a 
suite of spectrometers, a magnetometer and an electron reflectometer to 
investigate the composition of the lunar soil from orbit. It was hoped 
that the instruments would find proof of the existence of water-ice On 
the Moon. Lunar Prospector did find traces of hydrogen in the south pole
 craters, but the jury is still out on whether this means that there is 
waterice or not. At the end of its mission, Lunar Prospector was even 
crashed into a deep crater On the south pole of the Moon, in an attempt 
to throw up a cloud of icy material. It was hoped that this could be 
analyzed by groundbased telescopes, but nothing was seen. If there 
really are large quantities of water-ice to be found On the Moon, this 
may be very valuable for future human exploration. The water can be used
 for drinking and cleaning, and could be split into oxygen and hydrogen 
to be used as rocket propellant. Moreover, the oxygen could be used in 
the life-support systems of crewed lunar bases and other spacecraft. The
 latest mission to the Moon is ESA's SMART 1, the ion-propelled 
spacecraft presented earlier in this book. At the time of writing, the 
little explorer is still actively mapping the surface composition of the
 Moon. SMART 1 is also looking for water-ice inside the south pole 
craters. Anew Moon<br>
<br>
What has all this exploration of the Moon taught us? Quite a lot in 
fact, and much more than we could ever have hoped to find out using only
 telescopes On Earth. The Moon is quite large compared to Earth, about 
27 percent of Earth's diameter. All other moons in the Solar System, 
although sometimes larger in actual size than our Moon, are much smaller
 in comparison to their mother planet. Many scientists therefore regard 
the Earth-Moon system as a "double planet." However, the Moon is very<br>
<br>
177<br>
<br>
 Chapter 7 different from Earth: it does not have an atmosphere, not 
much water, if any, and certainly no life. The Moon has always played an
 important role in our lives, especiallyin the past. Its light made the 
night less dark and the phases of the Moon formed a way to measure time 
and maintain a calendar. The lunar phases also helped early seafarers to
 keep track of the tides, which was important for fishing and entering 
or leaving harbors. Its mysterious motions across the sky, the 
continuous changing of its appearance and the terrifying phenomena of 
lunar and solar eclipses that the Moon causes suggested that it was 
associatedwith the gods. Even now, after people have walked over its 
surface, the Moon still fills us with a sense of mystery and romance and
 triggers people to change into werewolves even in modern movies. Long 
before the dawn of humans the Moon had played a crucial role in the 
formation of life. It is currently believed that the tidal pools that 
were sometimes under water, and sometimes dry due to the gravitational 
attraction of the Moon on the sea, are the places were life first 
started . Moreover, as it circled the Earth, the Moon has had a 
stabilizing effect on the tilt of the Earth's axis, helping to keep the 
climate relatively stable. The robotic and human missions to the Moon 
have in half a century taught us much more about it than all the 
previous thousands of years of astronomical observations. Thanks to 
space exploration, our knowledge of the Moon has vastly increased within
 the span of only a few decades. As Earth and Moon have shared 4,500 
million years of history together, retracing its past helps scientists 
to better understand what has happened to our own home planet. One of 
the main questions about the Moon is: Where did it come from? The most 
widely accepted theory is that when the Earth was perhaps 50 to 100 
million years old, some 4.6 billions of years ago, it collided with a 
massive, wandering planetary object the size of Mars. The impact was a 
glancing blow, and the debris that was knocked off our planet and the 
perpetrator during this enormous crash went into orbit . Over time, this
 material merged to form the Moon. The impact would have completely 
disturbed the outer layers of the Earth, so the theory also holds 
important implications for how we think the Earth has formed. In fact, 
if the outer skin of the Earth indeed was blown off, then the Moon 
should mostly contain relatively light material; the heavier items like 
iron had at the time already sunk to the core of the Earth, so the outer
 parts that formed the Moon should contain mostly lighter materials such
 as magnesium and aluminum. 178<br>
<br>
 Distant Destinations Whether the Moon contains more light materials 
than Earth is something that is currently being investigated by the 
SMART 1 orbiter, and its results have the potential to make or break the
 theory about the formation of the Moon. After the Moon was formed and 
its outer layers solidified, it was bombarded by rogue meteoroids, 
comets and asteroids that scarred its surface with innumerable craters 
of all sizes. The very largest impacts cracked its outer shell, allowing
 liquid magma to flow over the surfaceand form the relatively smooth 
lunar "seas." The damage was never cleaned up by the erosion ofwater, 
air and plate tectonics as happened on Earth, but stayed visible 
forever. As a result, when we look at the Moon in the night sky we can 
still get an idea of the horrible ordeal it has suffered over billions 
of years. Now the Moon seems silent and dead. However, sometimes 
astronomers (often amateurs, as they are about the only group still 
studying the Moon through telescopes) report having seen strange light 
effects or hazy gas clouds on its surface. The Moon may not be as 
geologically dead as we think, and some volcanic activity may still be 
happening on a very small scale.<br>
<br>
UNROMANTIC VENUS As the brightest object in the sky after the Sun and 
the Moon, the ancient Greeks named Venus after their goddess of beauty. 
Even in recent times Venus had a bit ofa romantic lure about it, as some
 scientists suspected the surface to resemble a kind of prehistoric 
version ofEarth. Mter all, Venus is only slightly smaller than Earth and
 the clouds that could be seen through telescopes clearly indicated a 
thick atmosphere with possibly lots of water. Its closeness to the Sun 
would mean that the average temperatures would be higher, so maybe it 
was hiding tropical forests teeming with life beneath its veil of dense 
clouds.<br>
<br>
Greenhouse nightmare Then our robotic explorers unmasked it for the hell
 it actually is; an extremely hot world of rolling plains, resurfaced by
 volcanic activity, crushed under a very heavy carbon dioxide atmosphere
 with a surface pressure 90 times that on Earth . That is as much 
pressure as a deep ocean submarine is exposed to at about 900 meters 
(3,000 feet) depth on our 179<br>
<br>
 Chapter 7 planet. Dark brown clouds drop "rain" of concentrated 
sulfuric acid. Temperatures on Venus reach 470 degrees Celsius (880 
degrees Fahrenheit), which is hot enough to melt lead. Because of this, 
metals vaporize and condense at cooler, higher elevations; the mountains
 and hills may actually be coated by condensing lead vapor! These 
appalling conditions are the result of a disastrous greenhouse effect. 
Heat from the Sun, already more intense than on Earth because Venus 
stands closer to it, is trapped by the thick atmosphere that acts as a 
planet-covering blanket. On Earth we are concerned that our industries 
and cars may be putting so much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that a
 greenhouse effect has been started. Some scientists are afraid that 
this could raise the average temperatures on Earth by several degrees, 
resulting in melting polar caps, floods and severe changes in global 
weather. On Venus the greenhouse effect is caused by the huge amounts of
 carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which were probably released in the 
past by volcanoes. Studying Venus can tell us a lot about the actions of
 greenhouse effects and what they can do to a planet. This directly 
links interplanetary space exploration with our trying to understand the
 greenhouse effect that could be happening on Earth, and as a 
consequence links it to our very lives. Into the unknown<br>
<br>
In 1960 the USA launched the first probe that traveled all the way to 
the orbit of Venus, although that planet was not in the right orbital 
position for an encounter. The Pioneer 5 mission was not intended to 
visit any planet, but merely to test communication with space probes at 
large distances. Earlier spacecraft had barely reached beyond the Moon, 
so staying in radio contact with a probe at the distance of Venus was no
 small feat. Pioneer 5 demonstrated that it could be done, and also sent
 us valuable information about the Sun's magnetic field and the solar 
wind. The Soviet Venera 1 was the first spacecraft to fly by Venus, when
 it passed the planet within 100,000 kilometers (62,000 miles) in May 
1961. However, unfortunately contact with the spacecraft had already 
been lost three months before, so the mission was not a scientific 
success. The first spacecraft to return data about Venus was NASA's 
Mariner 2, which was a backup for the Mariner 1 mission that failed 
shortly after launch. However, its success did not come easily. On its 
way to Venus the spacecraft suddenly lost its attitude control for 180<br>
<br>
 Distant Destinations about 3 minutes, perhaps because of a collision 
with a small object. Later the energy output from one solar panel 
suddenly dropped, and the science instruments that were active during 
the cruise flight to Venus were turned off. A week later the solar panel
 started to work properly again for some time, but then suddenly failed 
completely. Fortunately Mariner 2 was by then close enough to the Sun to
 be able to operate normally on one panel only. In December 1962, 
Mariner 2 passed the planet at a closest distance of 34,800 kilometers 
(21,600 miles), and ended up in an orbit around the Sun. The discoveries
 made by Mariner 2 include the high surface temperatures and pressures, 
the carbon dioxide atmosphere, the continuous cloud cover with a top 
altitude of about 60 kilometers (37 miles), the lack of a detectable 
magnetic field, the slow rotation rate of Venus, and that fact that it 
rotates around its axis in the opposite direction to the Earth and all 
other large planets. In the meantime Russia had to cope with a whole 
string ofunsuccessful Venus missions, which failed either due to 
problems with the launcher or because contact was lost before the probes
 reached their destination. However, in October 1967 Venera 4 descended 
through Venus's atmosphere, transmitting data during the descent. It 
gave us a first idea of the extremely unpleasant temperatures and 
pressures there. At about 25 kilometers (16 miles) above the surface, 
contact with the probe was lost; it had probably perished due to the 
harsh conditions. Veneras 5 and 6 had very similar mission profiles and 
were probably also crushed during descent, but Venera 7 actually made it
 to the surface and became the first man-made object to return data 
after landing on another planet. On December 15, 1970, the Venera 7 
lander separated from its cruising stage and plunged into the planet's 
atmosphere. As it came down on the side ofthe planet that was facing the
 Earth, it could send its data directly to a Russian deep-space control 
station in Crimea. As it descended , the scientists on the ground 
discovered that, due to a malfunctioning mechanical switch, the probe 
was only transmitting a single channel of data containing temperature 
readings. This was a disappointment, although they were later able to 
derive the atmospheric pressures from the temperature measurements. 
Venera 7 continued to transmit temperature data down to an altitude of 
about 10 meters (33 feet), when another disaster struck. Suddenly the 
probe's parachute somehow detached or broke, and the spacecraft crashed 
on to the surface of Venus. 181<br>
<br>
 Chapter 7 The mission seemed to be over, as the ground station was 
receiving nothing but background noise from the emptiness of space. 
Nevertheless, the station kept on recording, in the hope of eventually 
being able to decipher a possible signal from Venera 7 out of the radio 
noise. To their amazement, they indeed managed to filter out a very weak
 signal that had come from the probe on Venus! For about 23 minutes 
after hitting the surface rather hard, Venera 7 had continued to 
transmit temperature data. The signal had been very weak, because the 
probe had fallen with its antennas pointed away from Earth . The tough 
lander had managed to sent us the first in-situ measurements from the 
surface of another planet. The data proved that the surface was very 
hot, something that had already been speculated; Venera recorded 
temperatures between 237 and 246 degrees Celsius (460 and 475 degrees 
Fahrenheit), high enough to melt lead and zinc. The atmospheric pressure
 at the landing site was calculated to be around 93 times higher than on
 the surface of the Earth. Venera 8 more or less repeated the feat of 
Venera 7, and transmitted data from the surface for 50 minutes. It 
confirmed the high Venus surface temperature and pressure measured by 
its predecessor. Like Venera 7, it did not return any photographs of the
 Venus surface, but Venera 8 managed to measure the amount of light that
 penetrated the thick atmosphere . It turned out to be similar to the 
amount oflight on Earth on an overcast day.<br>

 Distant Destinations<br>

On February 5,1974, NASA's Mariner 10 passed Venus on its way to 
Mercury. It zoomed by at a closest range of5,768 kilometer (3,585 miles)
 and returned the first close-up images ofVenus. This also marked the 
first time a spacecraft used a gravity assist swing-by from one planet 
to help it reach another. In October 1975 the Venera 9 lander reached 
Venus and was separated from its orbiter. This lander had been 
specifically adapted to the now known harsh conditions. It had a cooling
 system with circulating fluid that enabled it to survive for 53 minutes
 after landing. Most of the instrumentation and electronics were 
contained in a hermetically sealed pressure vessel for maximum 
protection. During descent, three parachutes and a disk-shaped structure
 acting as an aerodynamic drag brake ensured a soft landing, further 
cushioned by a compressible metal structure on the bottom. Venera 9 was 
the first to show us what the surface ofVenus looked like. Successful 
television photography revealed dust-free air and a variety of rocks of 
30 to 40 centimeters (12 to 16 inches) in diameter. The same year, 
Venera 10 showed large pancake-shaped and weathered rocks that looked 
like slabs of lava. Did this mean that some volcanoes were still active 
on Venus? In 1978 NASA sent two Pioneer probes to Venus, one to orbit 
the planet and the other to deliver four smaller probes. NASA's Pioneer 
12, also known as Pioneer-Venus 1, reached the planet in December 1978. 
Its highly elliptical orbit around Venus brought it to within 160 
kilometers (100 miles) of the surface to do radar mapping, study the 
clouds and make readings of the magnetosphere. . The radar system on 
board Pioneer 12 was able to look through the murky atmosphere . The 
maps that were sent back showed impressive plateaus, towering volcanoes 
and broad valleys larger than similar features on Earth . In the north 
of the planet the spacecraft spotted a mountain chain larger than the 
Himalayas. There were also some very large craters, that may have been 
gigantic volcanoes, but unfortunately the images were not detailed 
enough to find out. Pioneer 13, also called Pioneer-Venus 2, carried 
four small probes that were dropped into the atmosphere ofVenus in early
 December 1978. To survive the free-fall through the dense, corrosive 
atmosphere, the scientific instruments on board the probes had to be 
encased in titanium spheres. Casting and machining the titanium to the 
critical tolerances required more than 9 months for each container. "The
 project was like sculpting in titanium," recalled one engineer who was 
involved in the project. The Pioneer 13 mothership launched one large 
315-kilogram (694183<br>
<br>
 Chapter 7 pound) probe toward the surface of the planet in November 
1978. Instruments peered through a small window, made from diamond to be
 able to withstand the extreme outside pressures. A couple of days later
 three smaller 75-kilogram (165-pound) probes followed. The entry probes
 dove into the atmosphere and gathered data at different locations until
 they crashed onto the surface. One of the small probes actually 
survived the hard landing and transmitted data for 68 minutes from the 
surface. The Pioneer-Venus 2 mothership also arrived at Venus in 
December, entering the upper atmosphere as a probe and burning up as it 
went down. In December 1978, Veneras 11 and 12 descended through the 
atmosphere and reached the surface only 800 kilometers apart from each 
other. In addition to the same sensors as their predecessors, they also 
carried instruments capable of measuring lightning. Venera 11 counted an
 astonishing average of 25 flashes per second! Both probes reached the 
surface and transmitted data from there. Unfortunately, neither sent 
back any images because their television view ports failed to open. 
Venera 13 and Venera 14 were identical spacecraftlaunched only 5 days 
apart in 1981. The spacecraftdescent crafts and landers carried 
instruments to measure the composition of the atmosphere, monitor the 
spectrum of scattered sunlight, and record lightning during their 
descent. Once on the surface, the twin spacecraft made panoramic 
pictures with their camera systems, and their mechanical anus began to 
drill out samples. The pieces of rock they obtained were deposited into a
 hermetically sealed chamber, where an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer 
measured their composition. Although Venera 13 landed in a highland area
 and Venera 14 in a lowland region, at both locations the surface was<br>

 Distant Destinations found to be composed of alkali basalt. The surface
 ofVenus thus appeared to be very uniform, and this was later confirmed 
by data from other missions. Both landers also carried a spring-loaded 
arm to hit the surface and measure its compressibility. However, Venera 
14 proved that Murphy's Law also works on Venus, because its arm landed 
on one of the ejected lens caps that had protected a camera lens during 
the descent. Instead of measuring the properties of the Venusian soil, 
it sent back data on the compressibility of the lens cap! Veneras 15 and
 16 were twin orbiters that mapped the surface ofVenus with radar 
systems that were much better than those of Pioneer 12. The Veneras 
found that Venus was indeed covered with volcanic scars, but they found 
no active volcanoes. The data was not only studied by Soviet scientists,
 but also by planetologists in the USA and Europe as, for the first 
time, Russia shared data from its space explorations with the West. 
Russia continued its exploration of Venus in 1984 with an exciting twin 
mission. The two spacecraft, Vegas 1 and 2, each had a mass of no less 
than 2,500 kilograms (5,500 pounds). In June 1985 both delivered entry 
probes at Venus. The Venus entry package of each Vega craft consisted of
 a 2.40-meter (7.9-foot) diameter sphere identical to those ofVeneras 9 
through 14. Like these predecessors, the Vega landers were to study the 
atmosphere as well as the surface. In addition to temperature and 
pressure measuring instruments, the descent probes carried an 
ultraviolet spectrometer for measurement of atmospheric constituents, an
 instrument to measure the concentration of water vapor, and a series of
 instruments for studying the chemical composition ofgrains and drops 
floating in the atmosphere. After landing, small surface samples near 
the probes were analyzed by gamma spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence. 
Apart from the landers, each Vega entry package also included a 3.4meter
 (l1-foot) diameter instrumented balloon that was deployed immediately 
after entry into the atmosphere at an altitude of 54 kilometers (34 
miles). The balloon supported a probe with a total mass of 25 kilograms 
(55 pounds). AS-kilogram (11-pound) payload of scientific instruments 
hung suspended on a cable 12 meters (39 feet) below the balloon. The 
balloons floated at an altitude of approximately 50 kilometers (31 
miles), in the middle of the most active layer of the Venus cloud 
system. Onboard instruments measured temperature, pressure, vertical 
wind velocity, and visibility to indicate how many small drops of liquid
 were floating around in the atmosphere. 185<br>
<br>
 Chapter 7 Mter two days, and traveling some 9,000 kilometers (5,600 
miles) through the atmosphere, the Vega balloons left the night side 
ofVenus and entered the day side. Because of the intense heat of the 
Sun, the balloons quickly warmed up, expanded and burst. However, that 
was not the end of the Vega missions. While the balloons and entry 
probes were doing their work, the Vega motherships had swung by Venus 
and were on their way to intercept the famous Halley comet . The first 
spacecraft encountered comet Halley on March 6, 1986, and the second 
three days later. Both flew by with a velocity of no less than 78 
kilometers (48 miles) per second, Vega 1 at an estimated distance of 
10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) and Vega 2 at about 3,000 kilometers 
(1,900 miles). The data they gathered during their short visits about 
the comet's orbit was very useful for targeting the ESA Giotto comet 
probe, which would pass Halley even closer. Magellan The most revealing 
Venus mission yet, NASA's Magellan, left Earth in 1989 and entered orbit
 around Venus on August 10, 1990. It was born out of another project for
 a very sophisticated robotic Venus explorer, the Venus Orbiting Imaging
 Radar, VOIR, that was cancelled because it was found to be too 
expensive. However, smart engineers combined hardware that had already 
been built for this orbiter with spare parts from other space explorers 
such as Voyager, Ulysses and Viking to create a new spacecraft that was 
named Magellan. Even equipment that had already been put in the National
 Air and Space Museum in Washington was incorporated to keep the costs 
down. Because the spacecraft also somewhat resembled a flower, it was 
nick-named "Secondhand Rose." Magellan was the first interplanetary 
spacecraft to be launched by the Space Shuttle. Once out of the 
Orbiter's cargo bay, a solid propellant rocket motor called the Inertial
 Upper Stage (IUS) pushed Magellan out of Earth orbit. It looped around 
the Sun one and a half times before arriving at Venus 15 months after 
launch. Another solid propellant motor then fired to place the 
spacecraft in orbit around the planet. Its initial orbit over the 
planet's poles was highly elliptical, taking Magellan as close as 294 
kilometers (182 miles) to the surface and as far away as 8,500 
kilometers (5,300 miles). Later, once the main part of its mission was 
over, Magellan was placed in a much lower orbit of 180 by 541 kilometers
 (112 by 336 miles). This was done by using the then still 186<br>
<br>

<br>
experimental and untried technique of aerobraking: carefully planned 
maneuvers sent Magellan dipping into the atmosphere at the lowest part 
of each orbit. The atmospheric drag slowed the spacecraft down, 
diminishing its average orbital altitude and also making the orbit more 
circular. 187<br>
<br>
 Chapter 7 Magellan carried a very powerful radar to penetrate the 
opaque atmosphere and obtain spectacular images ofEarth's cloud-shrouded
 sister planet. During the part of its initial orbit closest to Venus, 
the radar mapper imaged a swath of the planet's surface 17 to 28 
kilometers (10 to 17 miles) wide and 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) 
long. At the orbit's furthest point, the spacecraft radioed the long 
image strip captured during that orbit, nicknamed a "noodle," back to 
Earth. The smart and economical design of the spacecraft allowed the use
 of the same large dish antenna both for the radar instrument and for 
sending the gathered data to Earth. As the planet rotated under the 
spacecraft, Magellan collected and dispatched strip after strip of radar
 image data. Magellan mapped Venus more complete and in more detail than
 ever before. Features as small as 120 meters (400 feet) could still be 
discerned. What scientists saw on them strongly reminded them of Earth; 
there were Californian earthquake faults, Hawaiian volcanoes, and rift 
valleys resembling those ofEast Africa and Europe's Rhine Valley. Long, 
parallel valleys and ridges like those of the Basin and Range province 
in California and Nevada were discovered. Furthermore there were impact 
craters, jagged quake faults and expansive lava flows similar to those 
on Hawaii and in the Snake River plains of Idaho . Magellan found no 
less than 167 volcanoes larger than 100 kilometers (62 miles) in 
diameter; on Earth only the main island of Hawaii has such enormous 
dimensions! Furthermore, there were more than 50,000 smaller volcanoes 
all over the planet. Clearly volcanism had dominated the shaping of the 
planet's surface; however, no active volcanoes were spotted. Nor was 
there any trace of plate tectonics, the most important geological 
process on Earth. Nevertheless the small number of meteor impact craters
 on Venus, only about 900, implies that the surface is relatively young 
and thus must have been renewed recently. The fact that these craters 
are evenly scattered over the planet also suggests that the whole 
surface of Venus is about the same age! The latest theory devised to 
explain this, suggests that the outer layer of Venus is much better than
 Earth in containing the heat from the liquid inside of the planet. On 
Earth water helps to make lava liquid and also lubricates the 
continental and oceanic shelves so that they can move over and under 
each other. Venus is so dry that the amount of heat that can escape 
through volcanoes or via movements ofthe surface is relatively low. 
Moreover, the high atmospheric pressure prevents some volcanoes from 
erupting, because it is pushing the magma back down. The heat builds up,
 until it gets so hot that the whole exterior of 188<br>
<br>
 Distant Destinations Venus cracks open and its outer layer sinks away 
in the hot magma beneath. In one short, cataclysmic move of cosmetic 
surgery, the whole planet is suddenly rejuvenated. The last time that 
happened may be no more than 200 to 600 million years ago; quite recent 
in terms of planetary age. This process would explain why the surface 
composition measurements made by Venera 13, in a highland area, and 
Venera 14, in a lowland region, were so similar. Magellan was also used 
to map the planet's gravity field by sending a constant radio signal 
back toEarth. Variations in the gravity field changed the spacecraft's 
orbital velocity, which could be seen in the received radio signal as a 
Doppler shift in frequency. At the end of Magellan's mission, in October
 1994, aerobraking was used to lower the probe's orbit until it plunged 
to the planet. Most of the spacecraft will have been vaporized by the 
fiery descent, but some parts probably made it to the surface.<br>
<br>
Venus Express Venus's next visitor will be ESA's Venus Express. The 
orbiter will study the atmosphere, and hopefully will make us better 
understand why Earth and Venus have developed so radically differently. 
Scientists want to clarify the origin of the violent winds that 
continuously blow around the planet. The atmosphere goes around Venus 
about once in four days, while the planet itself actually takes about 
eight Earth months to make one rotation around its axis. The result of 
the atmospheric "super-rotation" is that the winds blow with hurricane 
velocities. Venus Express may also finally ascertain whether there are 
active volcanoes on the planet. There is a bit of friendly competition 
going on between the various scientists involved in the project, to see 
who will be first to locate an active volcano. The camera that is 
primarily intended to image the movements of the clouds may also be able
 to find infrared signatures of recent lava flows. One spectrometer 
instrument is going to measure concentrations of sulfur compounds in the
 atmosphere, which may point out spots with active volcanoes. Another 
spectroscope instrument will measure the temperature of the surface of 
Venus and may find hot lava that way. Also intriguing is a mysterious 
layer in the atmosphere that blocks ultraviolet radiation. We currently 
do not know its composition, but one theory suggests absorption by 
micro-organisms. High above the lethal 189<br>
<br>
 Chapter 7 areas of the atmosphere, some form of microscopic life may 
just be able to survive. Mter all, at an altitude of 50 kilometers (30 
miles) the pressure is about the same as on the surface of the Earth and
 the temperature is a pleasant 20 degrees Celsius (70 degrees 
Fahrenheit). The measurements made by Venus Express can help us to find 
out. Other important issues that Venus Express is going to investigate 
are: the formation and evolution of clouds and haze at different 
altitudes; the origin ofmysterious ultraviolet marks at the clouds tops;
 the processes that govern the chemical state of the atmosphere ; the 
role greenhouse effect plays in the global evolution of the Venusian 
climate; the processes by which gasses escape from the atmosphere; and 
the cause of the global volcanic resurfacing of Venus a couple of 
hundred million years ago. The spacecraft will mainly study the 
atmosphere, but is also going to see the surface; even though the 
atmosphere is opaque for visible light, there is a kind of 
electromagnetic " window" in the infrared . This was confirmed by the 
Galileo spacecraft when it flew past Venus on its way to Jupiter, and 
Venus Express is going to be the first spacecraft to take advantage of 
it. Venus Express is reusing the basic spacecraft design of ESA's Mars 
Express probe and carries the kind of instruments originally developed 
for Mars Express and Rosetta. By reusing and adapting already existing 
spacecraft equipment and scientific instruments, Venus Express was 
developed and built very quickly and for relatively little money. It 
took only three years to go from project approval to the launch pad. 
However, when Venus Express was all set to launch, ESA engineers 
discovered that small particles ofinsulation material from the rocket 
fairing had fallen onto the spacecraft. The launch had to be delayed, so
 that the engineers could remove the spacecraft from its upper stage 
booster and clean the orbiter. Fortunately, the pieces ofmaterial were 
found to be large enough to see and remove with tweezers and vacuum 
cleaners. On November 9, 2005, the Soyuz Fregat launcher that carried 
Venus Express finally left the launch pad. The spacecraftwas scheduled 
to arrive at its destination in April 2006 (while this book was being 
produced).<br>

MARS Mars, with its distinctive orange-red hue and its periodic loops 
against the background stars (due to the combined motions of the Earth 
and Mars in their orbits around the Sun), has mystified and intrigued 
people for as long 190<br>

as can be remembered. The ancient Greeks, and later the Romans, linked 
it to the god of war. In more modem times Mars became the subject of 
creative observers who believed they could see artificial channels on 
the surface of the planet through their telescopes. In their opinion the
 lines they discovered were simply too even and straight to be of 
natural origin, which led to the conclusion that Mars must be inhabited 
by intelligent beings. For many writers this was the inspiration for 
stories about malevolent Martians that meant no good to planet Earth, 
often wanting to destroy or to invade our world. This gave Mars a rather
 bad image with the public, something that the innocent red planet 
really didn't deserve. H.G. Wells's The War if the Worlds of 1898 had a 
particularly huge 191<br>
<br>
 Chapter 7 influence when, in 1938, Orson Welles adapted it as a radio 
play. The broadcast led to an enormous panic in the United States, as 
many unsuspecting listeners really thought that a Martian invasion was 
in progress. Partly because of such fantasies, serious scientists also 
turned their attention to Mars, if only to invalidate the horror 
stories.<br>
<br>
Stumbling toward Mars Mars had already become a target for both the 
Soviet Union and the United States very early in the space age. After 
some attempts that failed during or just after launch, Russia managed to
 send Mars 1 on its way on November 1, 1962. As with so many of those 
early exploration missions into the Solar System, Mars 1 was not a 
complete success. The probe did zoom past Mars as planned and passed 
within 200,000 kilometers (124,000 miles), but because radio contact had
 been lost three months earlier no pictures or other data about Mars was
 received on Earth. The first 21 detailed images of Mars were sent back 
by the American Mariner 4 probe, after it flew past the red planet at 
10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) in July 1965. The hoped for Mars canals 
and large areas covered with alien vegetation that even some scientists 
had expected to exist were nowhere to be seen. In fact, the Martian 
surface looked surprisingly like that of the Moon with its craters and 
hills. Both the general public as well as scientists were disappointed 
in the dull, monotonous landscape that Mariner 4 presented them with . 
Mariners 6 and 7, which flew by Mars only a few days before Neil 
Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin stepped on the Moon, did however show a much 
more spectacular side of Mars. On the new images we saw extremely deep 
canyons, vast areas covered with sand dunes and mysterious landscapes 
that seemed to be sculpted by large amounts of water that one time 
flowed over the now dry planet. And there was clearly much more to be 
discovered, because the pictures of the two spacecraft together only 
covered about 20 percent of the surface of the planet. In November 1971,
 Mariner 9 ignited its thrusters to become the first spacecraft to go in
 a continuous orbit around Mars. Instead of flying by and snapping only a
 few pictures, as its predecessors had done, it mapped the entire 
planet. Mariner 9 sent back no less than 7,329 images and gave us a 
remarkable overview of what appeared to be a very interesting planet 
after all. When it arrived, Mariner 9 found the whole planet to be 
covered in a 192<br>
<br>
 Distant Destinations gigantic dust storm. Once the dust cleared, 
scientists were surprised to find four enormous dead volcanoes, each 
much wider and higher than the largest volcano on Earth. The most 
spectacular of them all was Olympus Mons, a giant that rises 25 
kilometers (16 miles) above the surrounding landscape. It is the largest
 volcano in the entire Solar System. Another spectacular surprise was 
Valles Marineris, a vast system of canyons that dwarfs the Grand Canyon.
 It is about 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) long and at some places no 
less than 7 kilometers (4 miles) deep. Valles Marineris appears to be an
 enormous fracture, possible the result of defonnation of the surface by
 the four large volcanoes. The Soviets tried again in 1971 with Mars 2 
and Mars 3, both consisting ofan orbiter and a lander. The Mars 2 lander
 hit the ground too hard, but the Mars 3 lander made the first 
successful landing on the Martian surface. Unfortunately contact was 
lost after a mere 21 seconds, even before any picture could be sent to 
Earth. Later analyses showed that the unfortunate probe had probably 
landed in the middle ofone ofthe gigantic dust stonns that harass Mars. 
The missions of the Mars 2 and Mars 3 orbiters were, however, a complete
 success. For months they sent a steady stream of scientific data back 
to the scientists on Earth . Further missions were attempted in 1973, 
when Russia launched the Mars 4 and Mars 5 orbiters as well as the Mars 6
 lander. Again they ran out of luck, as Mars 4 passed the planet instead
 of going into orbit around it and contact with Mars 6 was lost just 
before landing. Mars 5 did get into orbit around Mars, but only operated
 for a short time due to an error in a computer chip. Furthermore, the 
few images it managed to return were ofa much lower quality than those 
already sent by Mariner 9.<br>
<br>
Viking invasion The most spectacular missions to Mars until then arrived
 in 1976, when the USA put its two Viking spacecraft in orbit around the
 planet. As Mars was at that time covered by an enormous dust storm, the
 landers of the twin spacecraft had to remain docked to their 
motherships longer than planned. However, as soon as the storm had 
subsided, the two landers went down, Viking 1 on July 20 and Viking 2 on
 September 3, and made successful landings on the dusty red surface. The
 Viking landers sent back the first pictures of the surface of Mars. The
 images showed rusty brown plains covered with dust and rocks of 193<br>

all sizes under a pink sky due to the high amount of red dust in the 
atmosphere. The weather stations on board the landers measured that the 
temperatures at the landing sites varied between -85 and -3 degrees 
Celsius (-121 and +27 degrees Fahrenheit). A light wind was blowing, 
which changed direction every day according to a fixed, predictable 
pattern. The atmospheric pressure on the surface was found to be only 8 
millibars, very low in comparison with the average 1,000-millibar 
pressure we are used to on Earth at sea level. Viking lander 
measurements also showed that the atmosphere contains 95 percent carbon 
dioxide, 3 percent nitrogen and 2 percent argon, oxygen, carbon monoxide
 and other gasses. Very different from the Earth's atmosphere, which 
contains 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, less than 1 percent 
carbon dioxide and an even lower amount of other gasses. The humidity of
 the Mars atmosphere at the surface was found to be extremely low. The 
landers also investigated the soil by scooping up some sample material 
and dropping it in an ingenious, automatic mini-laboratory . The ground 
was found to contain silicon (15 to 30 percent), iron (16 percent), 194<br>
<br>
 Distant Destinations<br>
<br>
calcium (3 to 8 percent), aluminum (2 to 7 percent) and a little bit of 
titanium. Its red color was proven to be caused by iron oxide, also 
known as rust. Scientists had furthermore prepared the automatic 
laboratories with a range of experiments to look for (bacterial) life on
 Mars (the Viking mission was the first ever to implement Planetary 
Protection measures). Unfortunately all their results could be explained
 by non-biological chemical reactions, and so no evidence of anything 
being alive on Mars was found. Disaster strikes<br>
<br>
After Vikings 1 and 2, it took no less than 12 years before we returned 
to Mars. The Soviets then launched their two Phobos probes. The target 
for these missions was however not Mars itself, but Phobos, one of the 
two small moons orbiting Mars. The Phobos probes would both slowly orbit
 this moon, and Phobos 2 would drop two small landers on the surface for
 furtherinvestigation. Tragically, Phobos 1 was lost before it reached 
its destination due to a faulty command sent by the mission control on 
Earth. In an entirely unexpected reaction, Phobos 1 switched itself off 
completely and refused to be powered up again. Investigations later 
showed that the disastrous software routine that enabled the inadvertent
 shutoff command had originated in the testing phase back on Earth. For 
the test model of the Phobos probe temporary commands had been built 
into the software to enable test engineers to quickly shut down parts or
 even the entire spacecraft. For the actual flight software, programmers
 forgot to delete the now unnecessary and potentially dangerous software
 lines. Murphy's Law - which says that if something can be done in the 
wrong way, someone is bound to do just that - did the rest. Phobos 2 had
 approached the moon Phobos to within a distance ofonly 10 kilometers (6
 miles) when contact with this probe was also suddenly lost. This 
happened just after Phobos 2 had made pictures ofMars and was commanded 
to aim its main antenna back to Earth again. Nothing was ever heard from
 the spacecraft; probably control problems had claimed this unfortunate 
space explorer too. NASA was also unsuccessful in returning to Mars with
 the Mars Observer orbiter in September 1992. Just before it arrived at 
its destination, contact was unexpectedly lost and never re-established.
 Later it was determined that the most likely cause for the loss of Mars
 Observer 195<br>
<br>
 Chapter 7 was a design error in the propulsion subsystem, which had 
probably led to a violent explosion of the probe when the two 
automatically combusting propellants got mixed inside the piping to the 
thrusters .<br>
<br>
Return to the red planet NASA's Mars Global Surveyor was launched in 
November 1996 and arrived at Mars about a year later. This was the first
 spacecraft that had been designed to use aerobraking as a fundamental 
part of its mission. Aerobraking had been successfully demonstrated in 
the final days of the Magellan mission to Venus, but had never been used
 previously as a socalled mission critical step. Mars Global Surveyor 
was initially inserted into a highly elliptical orbit. Then it used its 
solar panels to aerobrake in the upper layers ofthe Martian atmosphere 
as it dipped down during the low point ofits orbit. It even had special 
panels at the ends of its solar panels to maximize drag. However, a 
problem arose when one of the two solar panels hinged itself past its 
designed position. It appeared that the latch on the solar panel had 
cracked! Fortunately the mission operators were able to design a new, 
lower-drag aerobraking procedure that exerted less stress on the damaged
 solar panel. The disadvantage was that the aerobraking procedure now 
took much longer than anticipated: the mapping phase was originally 
planned to begin in the spring of 1998, but because of the delay it did 
not start until over a year later, in April 1999. However, the rest of 
the mission went very much according to plan. At the time of writing 
Mars Global Surveyor is still sending out a steady stream of very 
detailed pictures and contour mapping data from its laser altimeter. Its
 images have already led to new insights, probably the most spectacular 
ofwhich are indications ofthe existence ofunderground water reservoirs 
that sometimes break through the walls of large craters. Because of Mars
 Global Surveyor, we now know that Mars is a fascinating and very 
complex world - a true paradise for geologists and geophysicists, and a 
planet that , earlier in its existence, has been a warmer, wetter and 
more life-friendly place. Russia made another attempt to reach Mars in 
1997 by launching the Mars '96 mission, in which a total ofno less than 
20 countries participated. The ambitious mission consisted of an 
orbiter, two landers and two torpedo-like penetrators designed to 
descend at great speed and bury themselves deep into the Martian soil. 
However, the fourth rocket stage of the usually very reliable Proton 
launcher did not work and the probe presumably ended up on the bottom of
 the Pacific Ocean. 196<br>
<br>
 Distant Destinations On July 4 of the same year, NASA was much more 
successfulwhen its Pathfinder probe bounced over the Martian surface, 
safely tucked inside its airbag protection. Once the airbags were 
deflated and its solar panels, cameras and antennas deployed, the lander
 made marvelous stereoscopic images of its landing spot. Then 
"Sojourner," the little rover it had carried inside, drove off for its 
now famous exploration of the area. The mobile mini-robot was equipped 
with an experimental arm that could be placed against rocks to 
investigate their composition. Sojourner's travels and its encounters 
with fancifully named rocks like Yogi and Barnacle Bill could be 
followed live on the Internet. The NASA Pathfinder website received a 
record number ofvisits and for the first time made it possible for the 
general public to closely follow a robotic space exploration mission. 
The next two NASA missions, Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander, 
were complete failures . As mentioned before, Mars Climate Orbiter was 
lost when rather than entering orbit as intended, it crashed due to the 
mixing ofimperial and metric units in the software. Mars Polar Lander 
was also lost, possibly because of an inadvertent hard landing caused by
 the main rocket descent engine shutting off too early at much too high 
an altitude. The shock caused by deployment of the landing legs had 
probably been picked up by a touch-down shock sensor, which made the 
lander think it had already reached terra firma. The two Deep Space 2 
penetrators, which accompanied Mars Polar Lander on its mission to 
investigate the south pole of the red planet, were also never heard 
from. What happened with them is still completely unclear. For the Mars 
Climate Orbiter and the Mars Polar Lander/Deep Space 2 mission, NASA had
 tried to work on budgets that were too low and time schemes that were 
too ambitious, which left insufficient money and time for proper design 
verification and testing. NASA's Mars program fortunately returned to 
success with the launch of Mars Odyssey in 2001 (named after the famous 
space movie 2001, A Space Odyssey). Mter arrival in Mars orbit it 
started to globally map the composition of the surface, studying the 
kind of minerals that are present and looking for hydrogen, which could 
indicate the presence of water , in the shallow subsurface. It also 
carried an instrument to measure the radiation in space near Mars, which
 would help us to find out how dangerous this could be for future 
astronauts traveling to the planet. The results of Mars Odyssey, which 
is still working well at the time of writing, indicate that there may be
 water or water-ice hidden under the 197<br>

Martian surface. Many of the minerals it detected also indicate that 
lots of water once flowed over Mars. The radiation levels that Odyssey 
measured do not seem to be too dangerous for astronauts or too difficult
 to handle for crewed spacecraft designers, so one day humans should be 
able to go and land on Mars. ESA's Mars Express was the next spacecraft 
to enter orbit . It was Europe's first ever Mars mission, and although 
the Beagle 2 lander it carried was never heard from again after 
detachment from the orbiter, the mission of Mars Express itself has 
become a huge success. It has found indisputable proof for the presence 
ofwater-ice just under the Martian surface, and its stereoscopic color 
imager has mapped the entire surface in unprecedented detail. Mars 
Express has shown that the rocks found by the later NASA MER Marsrovers,
 which are thought to have been formed in the presence of water, can be 
found all over the planet. These "hydrated" minerals, so called because 
they contain water in 198<br>

their crystalline structure, provide a clear "mineralogical" record 
ofwaterrelated processes on Mars. Next to the finding oflarge amounts 
ofwater-ice, the most spectacular news was probably the discovery of 
traces of methane (natural gas) in the Martian atmosphere. This gas 
should be fairly quickly lost from the planet unless it is continually 
replenished. It could be that the methane is being expelled from deep 
inside Mars, or is produced out of the atmosphere's carbon dioxide by 
the Sun's ultraviolet radiation. Perhaps a large comet full of frozen 
methane has recently crashed on the planet. However, the most 
tantalizing possibility is that the methane is being produced by 
microbes, just as on Earth. Unfortunately none of the orbiters and 
landers we have sent to Mars till now carried the right instruments to 
find the cause for the existence of methane in the atmosphere. Future 
Mars orbiters and landers may take experiments that are specially 
designed to do that. Shortly after the arrival of Mars Express, 
Christmas 2003, the famous NASA Mars Exploration Rovers, the MERs, 
arrived on Mars. Each ofthe spacecraft, named "Spirit" and "Opportunity"

competition for children, carried a sophisticated rover much larger than
 the earlier Sojourner. As already described in Chapter 5 ("Instruments 
of Science"), the twin rovers have found ample e~dence of the large role
 water has played in the history ofMars, and they continue to do so. 
Although they were originally designed to operate for three months, at 
the time of writing they have already been driving around six times as 
long. Mars is currently under surveillance by three orbiters (Mars 
Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey and Mars Express) and two rovers. No other
 planet apart from Earth has ever been studied in such detail. We now 
see Mars as much more than a dry, barren and rocky planet, a red and 
larger version of the Moon. Mars is a real world , with canyons, 
mountains, volcanoes, beaches, riverbeds and polar caps. It is a 
geological paradise where no features are obstructed by forests, water 
or cities. At one time, it must have had a lot of water on its surface, 
probably even real oceans. There may have been life in that water. 
Recent studies indicate that Mars has even known ice ages, which may 
have covered large parts of the planet in snow and ice. Computer 
renderings ofwet and ice-covered ancient versions of Mars, 200<br>
<br>
 Distant Destinations such as made by Kees Veenenbos, remind us ofjust 
how Earth-like Mars may once have been. It is not hard to imagine 
ourselves walking through the canyons, chipping off pieces of rock to 
look for fossils. Mter Earth, Mars is the most hospitable place in the 
Solar System. The year 2006 should see the arrival of NASA's Mars 
Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), a satellite that will be able to see 
objects on Mars as small as a dining table. MRO will try to find out 
more about the history of water on Mars. How much was there? For how 
long did it freely flow over the surface? Its instruments will make 
extreme close-up images of the Martian surface, analyze minerals, look 
for subsurface water, trace how much water is circulating in the 
atmosphere, and monitor the weather on Mars. It will determine whether 
there are deposits of minerals that only form in water over long periods
 of time, look for shorelines of ancient seas and lakes and analyze 
sediment deposits placed by flowing water. It will also be able to tell 
if the underground ice discovered by Mars Odyssey and Mars Express is 
the top surface of a large ice deposit or whether it is only a shallow 
layer. The MRO mission will send us several times more data about Mars 
than all previous missions combined, transmitting about 10 times as much
 data per minute as any previous Mars spacecraft. The next Marslander is
 scheduled to be launched in 2007, when NASA's Phoenix mission takes 
off. Phoenix is targeted to touch down softly in the northern polar 
region, and will be the first spacecraft to do so. Rather than using 
airbags, a similar rocket system as was used for the Viking landers will
 ensure a soft and controlled landing. Phoenix is a stationary lander, 
but it has a robotic arm to dig down into the soil and deliver samples 
to sophisticated instruments on the lander's deck. This on board 
mini-laboratory is specifically designed to measure volatiles, such as 
water and organic molecules. Like a phoenix it will rise from the ashes 
of two earlier Mars exploration missions, namely the crashed 1999 Mars 
Polar Lander and the 2001 Mars Surveyor lander that was mothballed in 
2000 . Development of the Surveyor lander was stopped as a result of 
investigations into the failure of the Mars Polar Lander, which 
indicated that the Surveyor lander mission also involved risks that were
 too high due to insufficient testing and management overview. For 
Phoenix, the management and testing rules and requirements have been 
tightened, and the financial budget has been set at a higher, more 
realistic level that enables proper development procedures. After Mars 
Reconnaissance Orbiter and Phoenix, it is planned to send 201<br>
<br>
 Chapter 7 more landers, rovers and even missions to grab some surface 
samples and bring them back to Earth . The USA, Europe and Russia also 
aim to launch crewed missions to Mars sometime after 2030. It seems that
 Mars will remain in the spotlight for at least another 30 years.<br>

MERCURY, A SCORCHED PLANET Mariner 10, the spacecraft that first flew by
 Venus and used that planet's gravity to sling-shot further on to 
Mercury, is still the only spacecraft that has ever visited this little 
world closest to the Sun. It made three quick flybys of Mercury in March
 and September 1974 and March 1975. The orbit maneuvers needed to 
achieve this were very tricky to calculate, because each time Mariner 10
 flew around the Sun and recrossed Mercury's orbit, the planet had also 
to be at exactly that location! After the last visit, Mariner 10's 
propellant was depleted and the probe became uncontrollable. Mariner 10 
sent back the first close-up images of Mercury, and showed that this 
barren world looks remarkably similar to the Moon. Mercury appears dark 
gray and is covered by impact craters. One of them, the Caloris Basin, 
is larger than France. The shock wave ofthe colossal impact that created
 it traveled all the way around the planet and created an entire 
mountain chain on the other side! Now Mercury is dead; there is no 
water, virtually no atmosphere and no geological activity. The many 
craters on the surface testify that its surface is old and for billions 
of years has not been geologically renewed. Earth, and perhaps Venus, 
still have hot, molten cores; but similar to the way that small stones 
in a fire cool down more quickly than large ones, so has tiny Mercury 
cooled down long ago. Mercury has a diameter of only 4,880 kilometers 
(3,030 miles), just a bit more than a third of that of the Earth. The 
many ridges, some with a height ofmore than 3 kilometers (2 miles) 
probably formed when the core cooled down and shrunk. Like the skin of a
 dried-out plum, it made the surface ofMercury crack and wrinkle . If 
there was any volcanism, it would have been stopped at that time as the 
contracting crust closed-off the magma conduits . As mentioned above, at
 the time of writing NASA's Messenger spacecraft is its way to explore 
Mercury from orbit for the first time. ESA's BepiColombo with its two 
orbiters - one European and one Japanese should follow around 2012.<br>

GIANT JUPITER Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System, with a 
maximum diameter of142,800 kilometers (88,700 miles); 11 times that 
ofthe Earth . It was the first of the giant outer planets we reached 
when the 258-kilogram (569pound) Pioneer 10 flew by in 1973. The probe 
measured the atmosphere and magnetosphere, and made over 300 images. We 
quickly found out that Jupiter has a very strong magnetic field that is 
very good in capturing charged particles from its own moon 10 and from 
the Sun. The radiation levels caused by these particles nearly ended the
 life ofPioneer 10, when during its closest approach it had to endure 
some 500 times the amount of radiation that would be instantaneously 
deadly to humans. Fortunately the robotic explorer got no nearer than 
131,400 kilometers (81,700 miles), otherwise the even higher levels of 
radiation closer to Jupiter would surely have meant the end of it. 
Another surprising feature ofJupiter found by Pioneer 10 is that the 
planet emits about 1.7 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun.
 When Jupiter was formed , the enormous pressure inside the planet 
heated it up, like a bicycle pump getting hot due to the compression of 
the air inside. This is what ignited the nuclear fusion reactions inside
 the Sun, but Jupiter was too small and had insufficient mass to get its
 core pressure high enough to become another star. The first flickering 
Pioneer 10 pictures that built up on the screen of NASA scientists 
showed brown, yellow, orange and red cloud bands circling the planet. 
Then the famous "Red Spot" came into view. This oval feature had already
 been seen on Jupiter by the astronomer Cassini in 1665 and has been 
visible through telescopes ever since. Apparently it has been rather 
stable for centuries. It's no wonder that astronomers had thought it to 
be a solid object on the surface ofJupiter, or gas swirling around an 
enormous mountain. However, Pioneer 10 showed that it is in fact a 
gigantic, perpetual storm big enough to envelope the entire Earth twice!
 Jupiter consists of about 86 percent hydrogen, 14 percent helium and 
tiny amounts of methane, ammonia, phosphine, water, acetylene, ethane, 
germanium and carbon monoxide. The colored clouds consist of various 
compounds ofammonia and hydrogen sulfide (which, you may remember from 
chemistry classes at school, smells like rotten eggs) . Below lie water 
clouds. Even though the planet could contain over 1,300 Earths, its mass
 is only 318 times that of our world. This indicates that Jupiter 
consists mostly of gasses rather than fluids and solids. The center of 
the planet may consist of a small, rocky core of iron and 204<br>
<br>
 Distant Destinations<br>
<br>
silicates at a temperature of about 20,000 degrees Celsius (36,000 
degrees Fahrenheit), surrounded by a thick shell ofliquid metallic 
hydrogen that behaves like a metal due to the extreme pressure. At about
 46,000 kilometers (27,000 miles) from the center of the planet there is
 probably a sudden transition from liquid metallic hydrogen to liquid 
molecular hydrogen (Hz, consisting of two hydrogen atoms). Above the 
shell of liquid molecular hydrogen is the planet's deep atmosphere.

Pioneer 10 leftJupiter after a quick visit and is now on its way out 
ofthe Solar System. It carries a metal plaque engraved with the image of
 a man and a woman and information about the location of the world the 
spacecraft came from. At some time in the very far future other 
civilizations from another Solar System may intercept it. Pioneer 10 
will then become our mechanical ambassador. A year after Pioneer 10, its
 twin Pioneer 11 briefly visitedJupiter on its way to Saturn. It 
confirmed the findings of Pioneer 10 and sent us more pictures. Voyager 1
 and Voyager 2, each three times the mass of Pioneers 10 and 11 and 
equipped with much more sophisticated scientific instruments and an 
antenna dish 3.7 meters (12 feet) in diameter, reached Jupiter in 1979. 
They showed the planet in much more detail than the Pioneers had managed
 to do. The upper regions ofJupiter were revealed to consist of complex ,
 whirling storms where lightning frequently shot from cloud to cloud . 
On the night side of the planet we saw for the first time 
extraterrestrial auroras, created by electrically charged particles 
hitting the upper atmosphere in oval regions around the magnetic north 
and south poles.<br>

 Distant Destinations The biggest surprises came, however, from the 
images the Voyagers made ofJupiter's four large moons , Callisto, 
Ganymede, Europa and 10. Earth-based telescopes had never managed to 
picture them as more than small specks of light, but the Voyagers showed
 each to be at least as interesting as any of the planets. What also 
surprised scientists was that they were all completely different. 
Jupiter and its moons resemble a minisolar system. Callisto has a 
surface of dark, muddy ice more densely covered with craters than any 
other moon in the Solar System. Its surface must therefore be very old; 
it takes a long time to collect so many impacts. Callisto has probably 
remained virtually unchanged since the very birth of the Solar System. 
The moon Ganymede is larger than our own, and even larger than the 
planet Mercury. It has mountains as tall and as wide as those on Earth. 
10 is covered with layers of white, red, yellow and black sulfuric 
material, making the surface somewhat resemble a four-cheese pizza.Just 
above the rim of a picture of 10 an investigator spotted a mysterious 
fountain-like object, which was soon determined to be the eruption plume
 of the first active volcano ever found beyond Earth. As 10 
circlesJupiter in its orbit, it also feels the gravitational influence 
of the moons Europa and, to a lesser extent, Ganymede. The constantly 
changing pulls of the giant planet and the two other moons result in 
tidal forces that knead and therefore heat 10 up internally. (The same 
happens if you knead a ball of dough; the warmth is caused by the 
friction between the particles inside.) Jupiter's tidal forces heat up 
sulfur-rich rocks deep inside 10, releasing sulfurous gasses. When these
 break out to the surface, volcanoes spew them far into space. The 
released particles even escape the relatively low gravity of 10, go into
 orbit and get captured and charged by Jupiter's magnetic field. They 
are the main cause of the high levels of radiation around Jupiter. Icy 
Europa, for the first time photographed in detail by Voyager 2, is 
perhaps the most intriguing ofJupiter's moons. Slightly smaller than our
 Moon, it is covered with a smooth icecap that completely envelops it. 
When the first images of Europa were received, scientists saw so few 
craters that they were afraid the cameras were unfocused. We now think 
that the ice is several kilometers thick. Just as the interior ofIo, the
 inside ofEuropa must be heated by tidal flexing, and is therefore 
probably liquid. That means that Europa may harbor a giant water ocean, 
which might even contain some form of life. Callisto and Ganymede are 
now thought to possibly also contain water oceans, but Europa remains 
the 207<br>
<br>
 Chapter 7 most promising. Together with Mars, this moon is therefore on
 the top of many planetary scientists' wish list for further 
investigation. On its way out, Voyager 2 looked back toward the Sun and 
saw a backlighted ring. Although very thin, it showed that Saturn is not
 the only planet with rings. In fact, weak rings were later found to 
circle Uranus and Neptune too. Unable to brake and go into orbit, the 
Pioneers and Voyagers made only short flyby visits to Jupiter. In 1995 
however, the Galileo orbiter arrived for a nominal four-year mission of 
exploration. Closely sweeping by the various moons and using their 
gravity to change its orbit continuously, Galileo observed the planet 
and the moons in unprecedented detail. Prior to entering orbit around 
Jupiter, Galileo released a 339-kilogram (747-pound) probe that was to 
descend into Jupiter's atmosphere . Hitting the outer layers of the gas 
giant at an astounding 47.8 kilometers (29.7 miles) per second, the 
spacecraft had to endure a deceleration force 228 times that of the 
gravity on Earth . At the same time the temperature of its heatshield 
shot up to temperatures three times that of the surface of the Sun! It 
was like exposing the probe to the blast of a nuclear explosion at close
 range. On Earth, the deceleration had been tested by putting individual
 components into small centrifuges. These could rotate so fast that the 
equipment experienced forces as high as 350 g, i.e. 350 times their 
normal weight on Earth. It's like swinging a stone attached to the end 
ofa piece of string; the faster you rotate it, the heavier the stone 
will feel. The complete Galileo probe needed to be put on the much 
larger and more powerful centrifuge of Sandia National Laboratories. 
This facility resembles a thick, 24-meter-Iong (79-foot-Iong) beam with 
its rotational axis in the middle, the test object attached at one end 
and a counterweight fitted at the other side for balance. As powerful as
 this centrifuge is, it managed to rotate the heavy probe up to "only" 
200 g. To test the high-velocity flight through the hydrogen and helium 
atmosphere ofJupiter, NASA even had to build a special wind tunnel , the
 Giant Planet Facility (so named because it was designed for simulating 
the entries in atmospheres of giant planets such as Jupiter) . This 
facility was used to heat and pressurize the gas inside to such levels 
that when it shot out in the tunnel, it resembled the gas that the 
Galileo probe would encounter when diving into the atmosphere. To do 
this, the facility consumed no less than 165,000 kilowatts of 
electricity, equivalent to the power needed to propel the ocean liner SS
 United States through the water at 35 knots (65 kilometers or 40 miles 
per hour). 208<br>

Thanks to the good design and extensive testing, the probe survived the 
severe heat and deceleration, ejected its protective shields and 
continued to descend at a speed of about 100 kilometers (62 miles) per 
hour. However, later analyses of the sensor data sent back by the probe 
showed that its heatshield had almost burned through at the edges. 
Apparently the design calculations and the results of the tests 
performed during the development were not correct. This is not very 
surprising, as not much is known about what happens when a real, 
full-size heatshield hits an atmosphere consisting of mostly hydrogen 
and helium at such tremendous speeds. Fortunately the small probe 
survived, thanks to the large margins taken into account in the design 
ofits heatshield. For some 60 minutes it relayed data on the composition
 ofJupiter, as well as temperatures, pressures and 209<br>
<br>
 Chapter 7 wind speeds. Unfortunately the probe did not register many 
clouds; later analyses showed that, by chance, it had come down in a 
small and especially dry, cloudless area. The exact composition of the 
clouds and the conditions near them thus mostly remain a mystery. Having
 reached a depth of 130 kilometers (80 miles) into the Jupiter 
atmosphere, the little probe finally succumbed to the pressure of25 
times that on the Earth's surface, and the heat of 150 degrees Celsius 
(300 degrees Fahrenheit). The debris will have sunk further down into 
the depths of the atmosphere; and then the parachute, the aluminum 
fittings, and finally even (at 1,700 degrees Celsius, or 3,100 degrees 
Fahrenheit) the titanium shell must have succumbed to melting and 
evaporation . Ten hours after entering the atmosphere there would have 
been nothing left of the probe . In September 2003, after nearly eight 
years in orbit, the Galileo orbiter was also sent down into Jupiter's 
swirling atmosphere. The main reason was to ensure that a dead 
spacecraft was not left flying around at the end of the mission as there
 was a small chance that one day it might have crashed into Europa, and 
possibly polluted its native biology (if any) with microbes from Earth. 
As usual with modem robotic planetary exploration, Galileo's data 
continues to reveal surprises long after the actual mission has ended. 
In June 2005, NASA researchers announced that Amalthea, one ofJupiter's 
smaller moons, is not the single, solid piece ofrock that we thought it 
was. Galileo data shows that its density is lower than that of water, 
indicating that the moon is probably just a jumble of icy rubble that is
 only held together by its own weak gravity. . Clearly, more discoveries
 await at Jupiter, and we should soon return to this fascinating planet 
with its mysterious moons.<br>
<br>
SATURN The planet Saturn is best known for its magnificent rings, which 
are made up of millions of individual bands primarily composed of 
water-ice particles. The first spacecraft to see this world from close 
up was Pioneer 11 in 1979, which had used a gravity assist at its 
earlier target Jupiter to continue to the ringed planet. Only a bit more
 than a year later Voyager 1 arrived, and less than a year after that 
Voyager 2 passed by. The Voyager images, in particular, captured the 
true majesty of Saturn and its rings. Rather than a small number ofvery 
broad rings, the Voyagers 210<br>
<br>
 Distant Destinations showed that the planet is surrounded by thousands 
ofnarrow ringlets, kept apart and prevented from dispersion by the 
gravitational influence of small "shepherd" moons orbiting between them.
 Rather than the dull atmosphere seen through telescopes on Earth, we 
discovered that the complexity of Saturn's outside rivals that 
ofJupiter. Saturn is smaller than Jupiter, but its interior is probably 
very similar. Also similar to Jupiter, the planet is surrounded by a 
collection oflarge moons, each ofwhich is unique. Titan, the only moon 
in the Solar System with a real atmosphere, is the most interesting. The
 Voyagers discovered that Titan's atmosphere mainly consists of nitrogen
 and some helium and methane, and that it is covered with orange clouds 
made up of complex organic molecules. Titan is a kind of early Earth in 
deep freeze, situated in a part ofthe Solar System where it is too cold 
for its simple organic molecules to combine and form the building blocks
 of living organisms. When, in a few billion years, the Sun becomes old 
and expands into a bloated red giant star, Titan may awake from its 
slumber and become just warm enough for life to evolve. However, there 
will be too little time for much to happen before the Sun puffs off its 
outer layers and the core collapses to form a white dwarf Eventually the
 smaller Sun will cool down and become a dead, black star. The Earth 
will be long dead by then, scorched in the heat of the red giant Sun. 
(An intriguing story in relation to this is Stephen Baxter's novel 
Titan.) Iapetus is a moon ofwhich one half is snowy white while the 
other half is black. The fact that Iapetus always turns the same half 
toward its mother planet, just like our Moon, must have something to do 
with its strange appearance; it is the leading hemisphere in its orbit 
that is as black as a blackboard, while the trailing hemisphere is 
bright white. Enceladus looks a bit like the Jupiter moon Europa, but 
only part ofit is as smooth; the rest is covered in craters. It appears 
that the smooth area of this SOO-kilometer (310-mile) diameter moon has 
melted relatively recently, giving the little world a partial facelift. 
Enceladus is Saturn's brightest and whitest satellite, and has the most 
reflective surface in the entire Solar System. Mimas has a crater 
one-third the diameter of the moon itself, making it look like the 
infamous Death Star of the Star Wars movies ("that's no moon . . ."). 
The impact that caused it must have nearly destroyed Mimas. Tethys is 
also scarred by an enormous crater, and just like Mimas it also consists
 mostly of ice. Janus and Epimetheus share the same orbit and at one 
time formed a single moon together. Probably an impact, similar to those
 that nearly meant the end of Mimas and Tethys, broke the original 
satellite in two. 211<br>

<br>
Dione, Rhea, Hyperion and Phoebe complete the collection of relatively 
large moons, but, just as at Jupiter, the Voyagers found many other 
small, often irregularly shaped bodies as well. NASA's Cassini, the 
largest ever interplanetary robotic spacecraft except for the Phobos 1 
and 2 probes, is currently in orbit around Saturn. Just like Galileo at 
Jupiter, it is not just swiftly passing by as the Voyagers did, but is 
on a long cruise through the Saturn system. Using the gravity of Titan, 
it is continuously changing its orbit, so that it can visit different 
moons, investigate different regions of the magnetosphere and watch 
Saturn and its rings from various angles. Given that it took Cassini 
nearly seven years to reach its target, it would have been a waste had 
it only been able to take a few measurements at Saturn. Cassini was 
therefore equipped with an array of sophisticated instruments and 
cameras. It has already shown us new, breathtaking, views of the various
 moons and the complex ring system (see Figure 7.18). On double-faced 
Iapetus it has found a long, narrow and straight ridge roughly aligned 
with the moon's equator crossing its black hemisphere. This has led to a
 new theory that, in the past, Iapetus hit one of Saturn's rings 
edge-on. The ridge would be the scar left by this collision, while the 
ring material would have spread out over half the moon and covered it

with the black material we can still see. The side of the little moon 
turned away from the rings kept clean, explaining the strange difference
 in color between the two halves of Iapetus. When Cassini flew by 
Enceladus, its magnetometer measured a striking bending and oscillation 
of the Saturn magnetosphere, caused by ionized water vapor; Enceladus 
has a very thin atmosphere! Because its gravity is very low, the small 
moon is not able to hold on to the gasses for very long . Apparently the
 wispy atmosphere is continually replenished by Enceladus itself The 
source for this was also discovered by Cassini: cryo-volcanism (ice 
volcanism)! In addition, the Huygens probe of ESA released by Cassini at
 Titan in December 2004 has given us a much better idea of the 
composition of the moon's atmosphere. The probe found the atmosphere to 
be very turbulent and may even have registered lightning. It also showed
 that the thick 213<br>

 dust androcky debris, as shown in this Cassini image. {NASA]<br>
<br>
orange haze does not disappear at an altitude of 60 kilometers (37 
miles), as theorized before, but extends all the way to the surface. 
Fortunately it was transparent enough so that Huygens could for the 
first time give us a glimpse of the mysterious icy surface (see "Diving 
Through an Atmosphere," page 140). Cassini and its Huygens probe 
discovered that Titan's surface is covered in water-ice, which methane 
rain washes clean from a dark goo of organic substances that collects at
 the bottom of hills and mountains. Because of the thicker atmosphere 
and the lower gravity, raindrops on Titan are probably about twice the 
size of those on Earth, and fall more than six times slower from the 
sky. Similar processes of flow and erosion by rain, as happen on Earth, 
seem 214<br>
<br>
 Distant Destinations to have shaped the surface of Titan, but instead 
of being done by water, it has been done by liquid methane! Recent 
infrared pictures made by Cassini through gaps in the cloudy veil over 
Titan's surface suggest that the methane is ejected by cryovolcanism. 
The lava flows probably consist mostly of water mixed with ammonia. With
 a much lower freezing point than pure water, the mixture is rising to 
the surface from within the moon, oozing out as a viscid fluid.<br>
<br>
THE OUTER GIANTS: URANUS AND NEPTUNE Voyager l's planetary explorations 
ended at Saturn, and it is now on its way out of the Solar System. 
However, Voyager 2 was directed onward. Using the gravitational fields 
of each of the planets it visited, it traveled from Jupiter to Saturn 
and on to Uranus and Neptune. The alignment of all these planets had to 
be just right to make this game of interplanetary billiards possible - a
 condition that is very rare. In 1986, just over four years after its 
Saturn flyby, Voyager 2 arrived at Uranus. This giant gas planet is so 
far away that signals from the probe, even while traveling at the speed 
oflight, took 2 hours 45 minutes to reach us. When the images came in, 
scientists were somewhat disappointed with the view. They had witnessed 
intriguing patterns of clouds and storms on Jupiter and Saturn, but 
Uranus appeared to be a dull blue-green, featureless world. The planet 
was also found to be much smaller than its fellow gas giants. It was 
only a third of the diameter ofJupiter. The magnetic field of Uranus, as
 measured by Voyager 2, is much weaker than that ofJupiter or Saturn. 
The remarkable thing about it is, however, that this field is tilted 60 
degrees with respect to the planet's rotational axis. Unlike what we are
 used to on Earth, a compass on Uranus would thus not indicate the 
geographical north! The moons again provided a rich source of data for 
scientific debates, models and theories. Each of the five main moons, 
Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon, show the scars ofpast 
impacts. The surfaces of all except Umbriel appear to have been severely
 changed since the creation of the moons; liquid water seems to have 
broken through their surfaces and created spectacular ice formations. 
Miranda, with a diameter of only 480 kilometers (300 miles) has a 
vertical wall twice the height of Mount Everest! This and other 
extremely exotic surface features have led to speculation that this moon
 has once 215<br>

been shattered by a violent impact, then reformed out of the remaining 
fragments . It looks a bit like Frankenstein's monster (see Figure 
7.19)1 Voyager 2 also showed that Uranus is circled by a system of thin 
rings, just like Jupiter. Later, similar rings would also be found at 
Neptune. Voyager 2's "Grand Tour" ended with a visit to the last large 
planet in the Solar System, Neptune, in 1989. This gas planet is as blue
 and about as big as Uranus, but to the delight of the scientists it did
 show some clouds . The winds that propel these white wisps around the 
planet were found to be much faster than those at Saturn, the previous 
record holder for fastest storms in the Solar System. The big moon 
Triton was found to be a real oddball. From Earth, astronomers had 
already discovered that Triton rotates around Neptune from east to west,
 while nearly all other moons in the Solar System orbit in the opposite 
direction. Now they saw that it has geysers that spew out material up to
 an altitude of several kilometers. 216<br>

Voyager 2 showed that Uranus and Neptune are very similar, and that both
 are quite different from Jupiter and Saturn. Although their atmospheres
 mostly consist of hydrogen and helium, they also contain relatively 
more methane, which causes the plain blue-green color of these planets. 
As we now think that their atmospheres hide icy or slushy mixes of 
water, ammonia and methane, Uranus and Neptune are therefore sometimes 
referred to as the "ice giants." Their thick atmospheres may even 
conceal huge water oceans. In 1999 the University of California in 
Berkeley, USA, conducted laboratory experiments in which samples 
ofmethane were subjected to the conditions thought to be found deep 
inside Uranus and Neptune. The samples were pressurized to levels 
several hundred thousand times higher than on the Earth's surface, and 
heated to temperatures over 3,000 degrees Celsius (5,400 degrees 
Fahrenheit). The experiments produced diamond 217<br>
<br>
 Chapter 7 dust - both planets may have a kind of diamond rain, which 
slowly descends through the mix of water, methane and ammonia! Voyagers 1
 and 2 are still functioning and, respectively, are currently 14 billion
 and 11 billion kilometers (8.7 and 6.8 billion miles) from Earth. That 
makes Voyager 1 the record holder for the furthest space probe, 
signifying humanity's furthest leap into space. The Voyagers' plutonium 
power units should provide enough energy for transmissions to Earth 
until about 2020, but NASA may decide to save some bucks by stopping 
communications earlier. The last scientific mission of these famous 
probes is to measure the influence ofthe Sun's magnetic field and 
radiation beyond the realm ofthe main planets. Voyager 1 has already 
become the first probe to hit the socalled termination shock, where the 
solar wind of electrically charged particles that continuously blow 
outward from the Sun is slowed down by pressure from gas between the 
stars. At this termination shock, the solar wind abruptly slows down 
from its average speed onoo to 700 kilometers (190 to 440 miles) per 
second. In the same way that an initially steady flow of cars piles up 
at traffic lights, the collision with the interstellar gas makes the 
wind become denser and hotter. The higher density of charged particles 
also results in an increase in strength of the magnetic field carried by
 the solar particles. The decrease in velocity and the increase in 
magnetic field intensity were both detected by Voyager 1. Like Pioneers 
10 and 11, the Voyagers will continue to function as envoys of humanity 
long after their power runs out. Both Voyagers carry gold-plated copper 
disks with messages from Earth. If the probes ever get intercepted by 
our descendants or an extraterrestrial civilization who are able to 
decipher the instruction on how to play the disks, they will be able to 
hear the sounds ofwhales, the wind, the sea and rock 'n ' roll music, 
and enjoy pictures ofvarious locations on Earth , animals, people and 
everyday life on our world. Like a tourist brochure, the disks may 
invite aliens to contact or even visit us, if humanity still exists by 
then.<br>
<br>
THE SUN By far most of the mass in the Solar System, 99.8 percent, is 
housed inside the Sun itself; the planets are mere aggregations of the 
dust and gas that were left over after the creation of this star. Fueled
 by nuclear fusion in its core, converting hydrogen into helium, the Sun
 provides heat and light to Earth . Without it, life as we know it would
 not be possible. 218<br>
<br>
 Distant Destinations The Sun is very large and stands relativelyclose 
to Earth, so with specially constructed ground-based telescopes there is
 a lot of detail we can see: the swirling bubbles on the visible 
surface, the cooler and therefore darker sunspots, and the jets of 
extremely hot gas that are ejected into space. Luckily for us, the 
Earth's magnetosphere diverts, and the atmosphere filters, a lot ofthe 
deadly radiation from the Sun. However, this also means that astronomers
 cannot detect everything that is happening on and inside our star from 
the ground. Another limitation is that from Earth we can only have a 
good look at the equatorial regions of the Sun; what is happening on its
 poles is hard to see. In 1990, ESA and NASA therefore launched the 
Ulysses probe to climb above the plane in which all the planets orbit 
(ESA build the spacecraft, while NASA provided the launch with the Space
 Shuttle and the RTG to power Ulysses). Using a gravity swing from 
Jupiter, it went into a wide orbit over the Sun's poles. Ulysses 
discovered that the solar wind, the stream of charged particles sent out
 by the Sun, actually has two components: a slow one emitted by the 
equatorial regions and a faster one blowing from the poles.<br>

SOHO andthe location of itsvarious Sun-observing scientific instruments. [ESAJ<br>
<br>
In 1995 the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory mission, SOHO, was 
launched on board an Atlas lIAS rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force 
Station . As ajoint project ofESA and NASA, the Sun observation 
satellite was designed to continuously view the atmosphere, surface and 
interior of our local star. From its position far away from Earth, 
SOHO's view was never interrupted by our planet . SOHO is orbiting the 
Sun in a very peculiar orbit. It is located at the so-called Earth-Sun 
L1 Lagrangian point, where it can observe its target without its view 
ever being blocked by the Earth. Lagrangian points are locations in 
space where the gravitational forces on, and the orbital motion of, a 
body balance each other. They were discovered by the Frenchman Louis 
Lagrange in 1772, when he described the mathematical "three body 
problem" ofhow a small object would orbit around two more massive bodies
 such as planets and stars. There are five Lagrangian points in the 
Sun-Earth system, L1 to Ls, and L 1 is a point directly between the 
Earth and the Sun (such points also exist for the Earth-Moon system). A 
spacecraft in this L1 point always remains in the same position with 
respect to the Earth and the Sun, and therefore it provides SOHO with a<br>
<br>
220<br>
<br>
 Distant Destinations<br>
<br>
continuous, uninterrupted view of the Sun and a direct line of 
communication with Earth . If SOHO was just orbiting the Earth, the Sun 
would often be eclipsed by the planet. If it was orbiting the Sun, it 
would be hard for ground stations on Earth to stay in constant contact 
with SOHO. The fixed L1 position makes SOHO a stable observatory both 
with respect to the Sun and to Earth. In April 1998 SOHO successfully 
completed its nominal mission, but it continued to work perfectly. On 
December 2,2005, it celebrated its tenth anniversary in space, and at 
the time of writing it is still being used. SOHO has allowed more than 
3,200 researchers to make major advances in solar science. The mission 
revolutionized our ideas about the solar interior, the solar atmosphere 
and the dynamics of the solar wind . Major SOHO achievements include the
 detection of rivers of plasma beneath the surface, a complicated 
magnetic layer on the Sun's outside, and the first detection of 
flare-induced solar quakes ("earthquakes" on the Sun). Moreover, it made
 many spectacular images and movies of eruptions called "solar flares." 
These arc monumental explosions on the Sun that are<br>

<br>
 Chapter 7 caused by sudden releases of magnetic energy, and emit as 
much energy as millions ofatomic bombs. The flares accelerate the normal
 solar wind (the stream of energetic particles expelled by the Sun) to 
"storm force," and also trigger the expulsion of enormous amounts of gas
 from the Sun in what are called "coronal mass ejections." SOHO can only
 see one half of the Sun at any time, but scientists used its data to 
develop methods to see what is happening on the other side. They found 
out that eruptions on the back of the Sun send ripples all the way 
around to the side visible to SOHO. In this way we can get warnings 
about solar storms earlier than ever, even before they become visible to
 us. This is important, because severe geomagnetic storms (caused by the
 powerful burst of the solar wind hitting the Earth's magnetic field) 
can disrupt not only electronics on board satellites, but also radio 
communications and even the electrical power supply on Earth (and also 
cause beautiful aurora displays in the atmosphere). SOHO also discovered
 more than 1,000 comets, which means that it has almost doubled the 
number of known comets. Comets are chunks of ice and dust that start to 
evaporate when they get close to the Sun, often developing beautiful 
long tails of expelled material. From its unique vantage point, SOHO is 
able to see comets grazing and sometimes even impacting the Sun. Many 
comet discoveries have been made by amateurs using SOHO images on the 
Internet. SOHO and modern computer information technology has thus 
enabled people from all over the world, from the United States to 
Lithuania and Taiwan, to look for new comets. Actual samples of the Sun 
were brought to Earth by NASA's Genesis mission. It captured solar wind 
particles in specially designed, ultra-pure silicon wafers. The Genesis 
capsule carrying the precious samples managed to return to Earth, but 
unfortunately crashed when its parachutes failed to open. Luckily NASA 
has still been able to salvage some of the waferswith their captured 
solar particles from the debris (more on this dramatic failure in 
Chapter 8, "Death of a spacecraft"). There are many other spacecraft 
observing the Sun from orbits around the Earth. Rather than exploring 
the Sun from a closer range, they are used as astronomical observatories
 above the distorting and filtering atmosphere to study the interaction 
of the Sun's radiation with the Earth's magnetic field.<br>

ASTEROIDS AND COMETS, THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM Apart from
 the Sun, the nine planets and their many moons , the Solar System is 
full of small bodies called cornets and asteroids. The first contain a 
lot of ice, the latter are rockier. On average, cornets have lower bulk 
densities than asteroids. However, due to fresh data from recent robotic
 explorers , the distinction between cornets and asteroids is no longer 
very clear. Some asteroids are now suspected to be former cornets on 
which all the ice has been evaporated by the Sun, leaving only the rocky
 core. Moreover, we have recently found out that rather than "dirty 
snowballs," as astronomers used to call them, cornets are more 
asteroid-like "snowy dirtballs." Fascinating as they are, asteroids and 
cornets can be quite dangerous. When they hit planets they create havoc,
 as was impressively demonstrated when fragments ofcornet Shoemaker-Levy
 9 crashed into Jupiter with the explosive force of several billions of 
atomic bombs. (Cornets are named after the astronomers who discover 
them; this was the ninth cornet found by Eugene and Carolyn Shoemaker 
and David Levy.) The geological history of the Earth is full of evidence
 of such collisions, like the famous Meteor Crater in Arizona. We now 
think that an asteroid impact was at least partly responsible for the 
extinction of the dinosaurs . Some 65 million years ago, a large 
asteriod hit the Earth and filled the atmosphere with dust . The Sun's 
lifebringing light was blocked out for months. It became extremely cold 
and most of the plants died, breaking the food chain and causing the 
death of, first, the plant-eating dinosaurs and then the meat-caters who
 preyed on them. In this particular case the impact actually helped 
humanity, as the disappearance ofthe dinosaurs gave little furry mammals
 a chance to prosper, develop further and eventually evolve to become 
humans. However, the next time a large cornet or asteroid comes crashing
 down we will surely not be so happy about it Gust have a look at the 
movie Deep Impact or, much more funny, Annageddon, and you'll get the 
picture). The geological and fossil record shows that life has probably 
been partly wiped out of existence by asteroid and cornet impacts many 
times in the Earth's history. Attack from outer space Between Mars and 
Jupiter there is a vast region full of small rocky bodies: the asteroid 
belt. The largest of these rocky worlds is Ceres, with a<br>
<br>
223<br>
<br>
 Chapter 7 diameter of 950 kilometers (590 miles), but most of them are 
much smaller. Scientists estimate that there are several millions of 
them with diameters over a kilometer. The asteroid belt seems to be a 
failed planet, a junkyard full of scrap left over from the creation of 
the Solar System. The original dust particles sometimes merged into 
relatively big planetoids, but the resulting large chunks apparently 
never managed to combine to create a proper planet. This was mainly 
because they were continually being stirred up by the gravity of giant 
Jupiter. Not all asteroids orbit in the belt. Some of them follow 
elliptical orbits that can bring them dangerously close to the Earth . 
As there are far more asteroids than comets coming close to the Earth, 
"planetary defense" should primarily focus on them. If we know well in 
advance that an asteroid is going to hit us, we may be able to land a 
probe with a large propulsion system on it and push it into a slightly 
different orbit. If applied on time, even a minute change in direction 
or speed can make it miss our planet. However, before we attempt to do 
something like that, we need to know what the surface of such an 
asteroid looks like and what it is made of The surface may, for 
instance, be too soft and unstable to withstand a lot ofrocket thrust, 
or the uneven distribution ofits mass may make it start to tumble if we 
push at the wrong place. We should also be able to accurately predict 
the orbits of potentially dangerous asteroids. Former astronaut Russell 
Schweickart therefore advocates landing a radio beacon on 2004 MN4, an 
asteroid about 320 meters (1,050 feet) across that currently has a 
chance of 1 in 10,000 of hitting the Earth in 2036. With such a beacon 
attached, we could track this potential killer precisely and calculate 
its exact orbit to find out if we are on a collision course. If we are, 
we may be able to do something about it, but only if we find out in 
time. That is why Schweickart would like NASA to send a radio beacon 
probe as soon as possible. However, scientists believe that ground-based
 observations of 2004 MN4 will be just as effective in fine-tuning the 
impact risk assessments. Until 2012 the asteroid is too close to the Sun
 for observation, but in 2013 tracking by telescopes on Earth should 
enable them to map its orbit more accurately. In 2029 it makes a close 
approach to Earth, and then we should be able to make the very refined 
trajectory determinations that will tell us whether we are in any real 
danger. In the meantime, we have already learned a lot about asteroids. 
On its way to Jupiter, NASA's Galileo crossed the asteroid belt and took
 the opportunity to make the first close-up images of two large ones.

asteroid - 55 by 24 by 20 kilometers (34 by 15 by 12 miles) in diameter -
 even turned out to have a little moon of its own, which was named 
Dactyl. The first real asteroid mission was NASA's NEAR (Near Earth 
Asteroid Rendezvous). It became the first spacecraft ever to go into 
orbit around an asteroid. The prime target was Eros, an irregularly 
shaped asteroid about 13 by 13 by 33 kilometers (8 by 8 by 21 miles) in 
size. The small, octagonal prism-shaped NEAR explorer was equipped with 
an X-rayfgamma-ray spectrometer and a near-infrared imaging spectrograph
 to find out what Eros is made of, a multispectral camera for detailed 
images, a laser altimeter to map elevations and depths on the surface, 
and a magnetometer to measure Eros's magnetic field. A radio science 
experiment using the NEAR radio-tracking system's Doppler shift would 
give some idea of the gravitational field of the elongated asteroid. 
NEAR, later renamed NEAR Shoemaker in honor of the famous deceased 
asteroid and meteorite scientist, Eugene Shoemaker, was launched in 
February 1996, flew within 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) of another 
asteroid called Mathilde inJune 1997, swept past Earth in January the 
following year, and then finally got into orbit around Eros on February 
14, 2000, the aptly named St Valentine's Day. Even though Eros is a 
quite big asteroid, it is still quite a small object and therefore has a
 very weak gravitational field. As a result, NEAR's orbit around it was 
very slow and very low; it circled the asteroid at only a 225<br>

couple of kilometers per hour and got as close as 24 kilometers (15 
miles) to the surface. This naturally enabled it to do some great 
science at close distance, and even enabled it to softly touch down on 
the surface ofEros at the end of its life (more on this in "NEAR Eros").
 The next asteroid mission, Deep Space 1, was launched in October 1998. 
Its primary task was to test new technology for future interplanetary 
spacecraft, in particular ion propulsion. But just like the later SMART 1
 lunar satellite ofESA, NASA's Deep Space 1 also had a scientific goal. 
It flew past the 3-kilometer (2-mile) diameter asteroid 9969 Braille on 
July 28, 1999, at a distance of less than 10 kilometers (6 miles). The 
spacecraft then moved on and passed the nucleus ofcomet 19P/Borrelly at a
 distance of 2,200 kilometers (1,400 miles) in September 2001. Japan is 
also joining the asteroid hunt. The ion-propelled MUSES-C probe was 
launched in 2003, and was renamed Hayabusa once it was put in space. 
After an Earth swingby on May 19, 2004, the spacecraft made a rendezvous
 with near-Earth asteroid 25143 Itokawa in September 2005. Asteroids are
 named by their discoverers, and appropriately this one was named after 
Hideo Itokawa, the father of rocket science in Japan. In November 
Hayabusa released a 600-gram (1.3-pound) lander named Minerva. The 
little probe was to have photographed the asteroid's surface and 
recorded temperatures there, but unfortunately contact was lost soon 
after the lander detached from its mothership. Nevertheless, the orbiter
 itself continued to operate reasonably well. For months it made 
detailed observations while circling the asteroid, then<br>

<br>
moved in to land on it for a briefperiod - a bit like a bird ofprey 
swooping down on its victim, but in slow-motion. (In fact, the 
spacecraft'sJapanese name means "peregrine falcon.") Hayabusa was 
planned to obtain a small sample by shooting a kind of bullet into the 
surface, then collect some of the expelled debris. In November 2005 it 
made two attempts to do this. The first time it touched down, bounced up
 once, spent 39 minutes resting on the surface and then launched back up
 in orbit again. Unfortunately it did not shoot its "gun," and thus did 
not manage to gather any surface material. A week later the second 
attempt may have been more successful. JAXA, the Japanese Space Agency, 
said that Hayabusa then probably touched down for a few seconds on the 
asteroid, and this time the pyrotechnical sample system may have worked 
successfully. At the time of writing, Hayabusa is on its way back to 
Earth . We will not know whether it indeed managed to obtain some powder
 from the asteroid's surface until its re-entry capsule lands in 2010, 
hopefully with a few grams ofpristine asteroid material. If so, it will 
be the first sample ofan<br>

 Chapter 7 asteroid we can investigate in a laboratory, other than the 
meteorites found on Earth which we know originate from asteroids. 
(However, at the time of writing the spacecraft is experiencing major 
problems with its attitude control, which has already moved the return 
date from 2007 to 2010.) NASA's New Horizons Pluto Kuiper Belt Flyby 
mission was launched in January 2006. Rather than seeking out the 
asteroids in the inner Solar System, this mission is going much further 
out . It will first passJupiter for a velocity-boosting gravity assist 
maneuver early in 2007, then reach Pluto and its largest moon Charon in 
2015. It will make detailed images and measurements as it passes by at 
high velocity. After that, the spacecraft is planned to fly on to 
investigate some of the icy planetoids (large asteroids) that orbit the 
Sun beyond Neptune, and include Pluto, in a region called the Kuiper 
Belt. Earth-based telescopes have already found some planet-like objects
 beyond Pluto, like Quaoar, a planetoid one-third the diameter of the 
Moon. The largest one confirmed is Sedna, which has an estimated 
diameter of about 75 percent of that of Pluto. However, astronomers have
 perhaps found a planetoid that is even larger than Pluto . It appears 
to have a moon, and observations with NASA's Spitzer space telescope 
have shown that there is methane-ice on its surface. Until it is 
confirmed, the object is named "2003 DB 3 13 ." As usual, for probes 
flying this deep into space, the New Horizons mission will incorporate 
an RTG with radioactive material for electrical power supply. However, 
there is currently a shortage of the needed plutonium-238, due to a 
security-related shutdown of the US Department of Energy lab that 
processes this radioactive material. This means that the probe did not 
get all the plutonium originally planned. Whether New Horizons will have
 sufficient amounts of energy to continue its mission after the Pluto 
flyby is therefore uncertain. Postponing the launch until all the 
required plutonium was available would have added three to five years to
 the probe's transit time and millions of dollars to the mission's cost.
 Later in 2006, NASA plans to launch a deep space probe named Dawn . 
Using ion propulsion, as pioneered by Deep Space 1, Dawn will travel for
 nine years to reach the two most massive asteroids known, Vesta and 
Ceres. It will first go into orbit around Vesta and stay there for about
 nine months. Then, using its solar-electric engine; it will depart and 
journey further out to reach an orbit around Ceres. Its investigations 
there are also planned to take about nine months. Both of the small 
planets to be visited are located in the main asteroid belt between Mars
 and Jupiter, but they are very different from each other.<br>
<br>
228<br>
<br>
 Distant Destinations Observations from Earth have revealed that the 
surface of Ceres is probably rather "primitive," meaning that it has not
 been altered much by geological processes. It seems to be covered by a 
layer of dry clay that contains water-bearing minerals , and it possibly
 has a very weak atmosphere and frost. Vesta was more active during its 
early life; it has been resurfaced by basaltic lava flows and may have 
been (partly) covered by a magma ocean. Wrapped in a layer of basaltic 
dust, it is also much drier than Ceres. Vesta has been pounded by 
smaller space rocks many times during its life, the debris of which have
 sometimes reached Earth . We know that some of the meteorites found on 
our planet came from Vesta because they have the exact same composition 
as the asteroid's surface. We do not know whether we already have pieces
 of Ceres in our meteorite collections, because we have not yet been 
able to determine the composition of Ceres below its clay cover layer. 
The only way to find out what Ceres is made of is to pay the asteroid a 
visit, as Dawn will do. The Dawn mission will investigate the main 
attributes of the two asteroids, such as their shape, size, mass, 
composition, density, their magnetic field and the numbers and sizes of 
craters on their surface. The most important issue that the mission will
 address is the role of size and water in the evolution of planets.<br>
<br>
Thawing ice balls The Solar System is surrounded by an immense spherical
 cloud of comets called the Oort cloud (Oort was a Dutch astronomer who 
first hypothesized its existence), enveloping the Solar System far 
beyond the orbit of Neptune. The cloud extends to perhaps around two 
light-years, or 20 million times a million kilometers (12 million times a
 million miles) - half the distance to the next nearest star. The comets
 are very loosely bound by the weak solar gravity at such distances, and
 can thus easily be disturbed by the passage of other stars. Their 
originally more or less circular orbits far from the Sun can then be 
readily changed, hurtling them into the heart of the Solar System. 
Following highly elliptical orbits these deep frozen, icy objects come 
closer to the Sun and partly evaporate, leaving beautiful tails of gas 
and dust behind. Comets are thought to be fossil left-overs from the 
formation of the Solar System, 4.6 billion years ago. They should 
contain the original material from which the planets, including the 
Earth , were made. Some<br>
<br>
229<br>
<br>
 Chapter 7 scientists also theorize that a proportion of the water on 
our planet was delivered by comet impacts, and that maybe even the basic
 ingredients of life were deposited by them . It is no wonder that 
comets have become the target of many recent space probes. The first 
ever mission to a comet only took place in 1985, when NASA's 
International Cometary Explorer, ICE, passed through the tail of comet 
Giacobini-Zinner at a distance of 26,550 kilometers (16,500 miles) . ICE
 had originally started its life as the International Sun-Earth Explorer
 3 satellite, and had been studying the interactions between the Sun and
 the Earth's magnetic field. With the help of some gravity assist lunar 
flybys, the spacecraft was sent on its way to the comet and renamed. In 
its new mission as ICE it studied the effect of the Sun's radiation on 
the gas in the tail of the comet. The first mission specifically 
designed to study a comet from closeby, Giotto, was also ESA's first 
ever interplanetary spacecraft. The probe was designed to encounter the 
famous comet Halley in 1986. Hurtling through the gas and dust 
surrounding the comet, it got as close as 596 kilometers (370 miles). 
The most difficult problem was how to ensure that Giotto survived long 
enough while flying through comet debris at a relative speed of 245,000 
kilometers (152,000 miles) per hour. At this velocity, you could cross 
the Atlantic Ocean in only 11 minutes! To stop even a small, 0.1gram 
dust particle from the comet at this speed would require a solid 
aluminum shield at least 8 centimeters (3 inches) thick. For Giotto, 
this would mean that the shield would weigh over 600 kilograms (1,300 
pounds) - much too high for the small spacecraft. Instead the designers 
chose to install two protective layers. The front, 1millimeter 
(0.04-inch) thick sheet ofaluminum would vaporize all but the largest of
 the incoming dust particles. A 12-millimeter (0.47-inch) thick sheet of
 Kevlar placed 23 centimeters (9 inches) behind the first would then 
absorb any debris that pierced the front barrier. Together the sheets 
could withstand impacts from particles up to 1 gram traveling 50 times 
faster than a bullet, and this is. achieved by a combined total mass 
that is far less than the mass of a single shield, which offers less 
protection. The combined sheets are called a Whipple shield, named after
 the American astronomer Fred Whipple who thought of it as early as 
1947. The Whipple shield worked very well. Fourteen seconds before its 
closest approach, Giotto was hit by a relatively large particle that 
slightly changed its attitude, but the sturdy little probe continued its
 journey intact.<br>
<br>
230<br>
<br>
 Distant Destinations The onboard experiments returned a wealth of 
scientific data, the most important being the images of the comet's 
nucleus. Giotto discovered that the heart of Halley's comet is a 
16-kilometer-Iong (10-mile-Iong) peanutshaped, coal-black body made up 
of dust and ice. Heated up by the Sun, fountains ofgas (from the ice) 
and dust particles could be seen spewing out of the comet, creating a 
foggy halo around it and a long tail behind it. Giotto survived the 
hazardous encounter rather well; most experiments suffered only minor 
damage and remained operational. However, the mass spectrometers, one 
sensor on the dust detector, a sensor on a plasma analyzer and also the 
multicolor camera were left permanently inoperable. The spacecraft was 
therefore sent on an extended mission to another comet . It flew by 
comet PjGrigg-Skjellerup in July 1992, at a distance of only about 200 
kilometers (124 miles). Sadly, no images could be made because of the 
broken camera. Giotto was not the only probe to take advantage of 
Halley's visit. Japan sent two probes, Sakigake an Suisei, and the 
Russians sent their two Vega probes that first flew to Venus then 
visited the comet. However, none of them came as close as Giotto. 
Encouraged by the success of Giotto, ESA embarked on an even more 
ambitious mission when it launched the Rosetta comet explorer in March 
2004. It will take this large spacecraft more than 10 years to reach 
Comet 67PjChuryumov-Gerasimenko. If everything goes right, it will go in
 orbit around the comet in 2014 and start the first long-term 
exploration of a comet at close quarters. Just as the famous Rosetta 
Stone enabled us to decipher Egyptian hieroglyphs, so we hope that the 
Rosetta spacecraft will make us understand what comets are made of and 
thereby what the early Solar System looked like. Rosetta will even 
detach a 100-kilogram (220-pound) lander called "Philae" - about the 
size ofa large TV . (Philae is the Nile island on which an obelisk was 
found that helped French historian jean-Francois Champollion to decipher
 the hieroglyphs of the Rosetta Stone , and thereby unlock the secrets 
of the civilization of ancient Egypt.) To prevent Philae from bouncing 
off due to the extremely low gravity of the small and low-mass comet, 
the lander will secure itself by firing a harpoon into it. The design of
 this harpoon has been something of a gamble, as no one really knows the
 properties of the comet material it will hit. Maybe it's so loose that 
the harpoon will not get a foothold . Or it might be rock-hard ice and 
the harpoon will simply bounce off. Scientists and engineers made their 
best guess and hope to find a reasonably soft but not too loose surface.
 231<br>

 Chapter 7 Another comet mission recently launched was NASA's Contour 
(Comet Nucleus Tour). It was supposed to fly past two or maybe three 
comets. Sadly, after ignition of the solid propellant rocket stage that 
was to push the probe out of Earth orbit, contact was lost. Through 
telescopes, observers saw three separate objects where Contour should 
have been; apparently the spacecraft and upper stage had fallen apart. 
An investigation board later concluded that probably the exhaust from 
the rocket booster heated up the spacecraft much more than expected; the
 structure could not handle the high temperatures and broke up. This 
failure once again showed that there is still nothing routine about 
space exploration. A more successful mission was NASA's Stardust. It 
flew past comet 81P/Wild-2 in january 2004, catching material released 
by the active comet using a special substance called "aerogel," which 
slows down and captures the particles without damaging them. A return 
capsule with this precious cargo landed on a lakebed in Utah on january 
15, 2006, giving scientists direct access to pristine comet material for
 the first time. A very short but truly spectacular interplanetary 
mission, Deep Impact, was launched in january 2005. The probe reached 
its target, comet<br>

 Distant Destinations Temple 1, on July 4 of the same year. There the 
spacecraft split in two, as the "Flyby" mothership released a smaller, 
370-kilogram (820-pound) "Impactor" probe in front of the onrushing 
comet. Several maneuvers were needed to ensure that the probe would hit 
at the right spot. Over the Internet, Impactor's camera showed viewers 
live pictures of the comet rapidly approaching. The images showed 
impressive craters and ridges on Temple 1's surface, getting larger and 
larger. The final picture was made about 30 kilometers (19 miles) from 
the surface, showing details as small as 4 meters (13 feet) across. Then
 the stream of pictures suddenly ended, as Impactor smashed violently 
into the comet's icy body at a relative speed of37,000 kilometers 
(23,000 miles) per hour. The impact of the washing machine sized probe 
released as much energy as the explosion of 4,500 kilograms (10,000 
pounds) of TNT! Subsequently, the Flyby mothership zoomed by the 
interplanetary crash site at a safe distance of 500 kilometers (300 
miles) and monitored the impact results. Its first images showed a huge 
flash oflight created by the demise of the Impactor probe. The 
illumination lasted less than a second, but like a giant photoflash it 
provided an excellent light source for the two cameras on Flyby.<br>

 Chapter 7 Their images showed massive amounts of dust and gas spewing 
out of the impact location, at an incredible 5 kilometers (3 miles) per 
second. Later analyses indicated that the collision left a crater close 
to 250 meters (820 feet) in diameter. The observation of the impact was a
 nice example of international cooperation in space exploration. Apart 
from Flyby, many observatories on Earth, space telescopes such as Hubble
 and XMM Newton, and even the Rosetta spacecraft were used to watch the 
spectacle with as many types of instruments as possible. The Hubble 
Space Telescope monitored the expansion of the plume of dust jetting out
 of the comet, which is about half the size of the island of Manhattan 
in New York. One hour after impact it showed that the debris had already
 extended 720 kilometers (450 miles) from the comet nucleus. Some 18 
hours later it was looking at a cloud that had grown to just less than 
3,200 kilometers (2,000 miles) across. By analyzing the spectrum of the 
sunlight that was reflected by the cometary materials, scientists were 
able to determine its composition. The first analyses showed that a lot 
of hot water vapor and hot carbon dioxide vapor was coming out - the 
initial heated material from the impact . Almost all the material 
ejected from the crater was in the form of tiny dust particles smaller 
than 10 microns, which is really tiny. The particles were a mixture of 
rocky dust and volatile solids. Comparison of the pre-impact to the 
post-impact spectra showed a 10fold increase in the amount of water and 
carbon dioxide, but a 20-fold increase in the amount of organic 
material, possibly excavated from the comet's interior. The overall 
density found was very low, only 0.6 gram per cubic centimeter (0.02 
pound per cubic inch), which means that the material is light, flufi)r 
and extremely porous . Temple 1 must therefore consist largely of 
extremely fine particles that are very loosely bound together. In other 
words, the comet more resembles a heap of snowdrift than a compact, hard
 snowball. Before the impact, scientists did not really know what to 
expect. Would the comet's consistency be rock hard, soft as snow or 
something in between? It was anticipated that the crash would result in 
large amounts of material being thrown out. However, there was also a 
slim chance that Impactor would quietly disappear into a fluffy comet 
body of very loose material, or shoot out at the other end . That would 
have told us something interesting about comets as well of course, but 
would not have allowed the analysis of the comet's inner composition. 
Despite its complexity, nearly everything on the mission went better 234<br>
<br>
 Distant Destinations than expected. A Russian astrologer nevertheless 
complained that the impact had upset her horoscopes and tried to sue 
NASA for 300 million dollars! After analysis of the data, Deep Impact 
will have taught us much about what comets consist of, how fragile they 
are and how large craters are formed on other planets and moons. Maybe 
such data will also help us to protect ourselves against possible comets
 heading for Earth.<br>
<br>
NEVER FINISHED Now, in the first decade of the twenty-first century, we 
have visited all of the large planets of the Solar System. Only the last
 of the original nine has still been left alone, but as scientists are 
regarding Pluto more and more as a rather large, icy planetoid, we may 
be excused for this. Eight out of nine isn't bad. Moreover, NASA's New 
Horizons spacecraft is on its way for a fast flyby of Pluto in mid-2015.
 We have also visited and even landed on some of the most interesting 
moons, asteroids and comets, and have sent out probes to study the Sun 
itself However, to conclude from this that our exploration work is 
nearly done would be a mistake. First, of all the hundreds of moons and 
hundreds of thousands of large asteroids and comets, we have visited 
only a very, very small fraction. Most of them we know very little 
about, and many have not even been discovered yet. You only have to take
 a look at the diversity of the moons of a single planet such asJupiter 
or Saturn to get an idea of the number of objects waiting to be 
discovered. Second, the fact that we have made a couple of visits to a 
planet or moon does not mean we know everything there is to know about 
it, or even enough to be reasonably content. If an alien probe were to 
land in the Sahara, it might signal to its masters that the surface of 
the Earth is hot and barren, and that liquid water and life are sparse. 
It would take a lot of landers and satellites for alien explorers to 
fully comprehend the diversity of our planet. Mercury, Uranus and 
Neptune have so far only been visited very briefly by flyby spacecraft. 
Moreover, we have never put anything in orbit around a moon of any other
 planet than our own. We do not yet even know enough about the Earth to 
truly understand its past or to predict the future ofits climate, even 
though we live on it and have been exploring it by foot, with horses, 
boats, submarines, balloons,<br>

 Chapter 7 airplanes, cars and satellites for thousands of years. We 
have employed unimaginable numbers and diversities of scientific 
instruments to answer the questions about our home planet, only to find 
more questions that have even resulted in entirely new fields of 
science. Most of the Earth's oceans and seas, which comprise the greater
 part of its surface area, have yet to be explored. How can we then ever
 assume to find out all there is to know about the rest of the Solar 
System by launching some tens, hundreds or even thousands of 
interplanetary missions? Most aspects of the worlds we have explored 
have not yet been investigated. New scientific instruments with new 
capabilities are needed to answer remaining and new questions, and novel
 missions are required to take those instruments to their destinations. A
 small sample of the big questions about the Solar System that remain 
indicates how much there is still to do: 1. Did life ever exist on Mars 
or any other planet or moon? 2. What are the characteristics required of
 a planet or moon to have life developing on its surface? 3. Does 
extraterrestrial life exist anywhere in the Solar System today? 4. How 
did the Sun and planets form, and what does that mean for the 
probability of Earth-like planets around other stars? 5. What has caused
 the atmospheres of Venus and Mars to be so vastly different from that 
of Earth? 6. Are there really large rings of comets and icy planetoids 
orbiting the Sun far beyond Neptune? 7. Do other planets and moons 
potentially have sufficient appropriate resources for people to live 
there in the future? New space missions will search for life on Mars, 
past and present, and will bring samples of the red planet's surface 
back to Earth for detailed study. Landers will be sent to drill or melt 
through the thick layers of ice that are hiding possible oceans of water
 on Europa and other moons . Specialprobes will further explore Titan 
and find out how it got its strange atmosphere and surface. 
Long-distance spacecraft will explore Uranus, Neptune and their moons, 
and visit Pluto and other smaller bodies at the edge of the Solar 
System. They will also continue further out to ascertain where the Sun's
 influence and family of planetary bodies really end. One day we may 
even be able send probes out to other stars. Once we can do that, 
billions of other Solar Systems await our exploration. Just think about 
the amount of investigation still left to do! Part of the beauty of 
space exploration is that it never finishes. 236<br>

PACE museums are a bit like natural history museums, full of skeletons 
and stuffed animals: nothing is alive, and if something moves it is 
usually merely an animated model of the real thing. The exhibition 
subjects are sometimes shown in simulations of their natural 
environments, but as hard as it is to capture the wildness of a jungle 
inside a museum building, it is even harder to simulate an alien world 
using wood and plaster. Moreover, space museums can usually only show 
scale models or test hardware built during the development phases; the 
real stuff is out there, in space. As real heroes should, most robotic 
space explorers do not end up in an exposition but finish their 
operational life on duty. Those that do not perish during launch 
failures or because of design errors mostly find their end due to empty 
propellant tanks or failing batteries. Some spacecraft are deactivated 
on purpose because they have outlived their usefulness; an explorer that
 ends up in empty space after a successful flyby of a comet or planet is
 often of no further value. Sometimes politicians pull the plug because 
the possible extra science 237<br>
<br>
 Chapter 8 resulting from an extended mission is not deemed worth the 
additional money required. Let's have a look at some examples of famous 
endings and remarkable recoveries out there in deep space.<br>
<br>
DOWN TO EARTH Earth-orbiting spacecraft end their lives in most 
inglorious ways. Crippled satellites in low Earth orbits, below an 
altitude of 1,000 kilometers (622 miles), are slowly de-orbited by the 
small but continuous braking effect of the thin atmosphere that is still
 present up there. Without propellant for their rocket engines or 
electrical power to activate them, their orbital velocity and altitude 
cannot be maintained . Spiraling down, the atmosphere gets ever denser 
and the drag increases, until the Earth's airy grip gets a firm hold. 
Then the poor satellites have a very rapid descent. Colliding with 
thicker air at 25 times the speed of sound, they bum up and often 
evaporate completely. If anything is left, it usually ends up at the 
bottom of the ocean. Sometimes old satellites are even actively 
de-orbited on purpose, to remove them to ensure that they do not end up 
being space junk that endangers other spacecraft (imagine a satellite 
with a velocity of nearly 8 kilometers (5 miles) per second hitting 
another spacecraftcoming from the opposite direction at the same speed 
...). They can be sent to their fiery end by using their last bit 
ofpropellant to slow them down and bring them back to Earth . However, 
satellites in higher orbits usually remain there virtually forever. 
There is no atmosphere to brake their speed, and they have insufficient 
propellant to push them back down . Sometimes they are expelled into 
graveyard orbits full of retired satellites, to clear their slot in 
useful orbits for new spacecraft. The Earth is surrounded by thousands 
of such dead spacecraft, which often fall apart after a while and become
 even more space junk. For large satellites in low Earth orbits such as 
space stations, active and controlled de-orbiting is vital; they are so 
big that large pieces do not bum up completely and thus reach the 
ground. Such spacecraft must be pushed back into the atmosphere at a 
precisely timed moment, or pieces could fall down in inhabited areas. 
The de-orbiting of the giant Mir space station was truly spectacular, 
with the huge assembly of coupled modules braking down into individual<br>

<br>
 Death of a Spacecraft elements that each tracked long arcs of fire 
across the sky. Big pieces reached the Earth's surface, but fell down 
harmlessly into the ocean thanks to the excellent planning of the 
Russian ground control teams. However, not all spacecraft falling back 
to Earth burn away or finish up at the bottom of the sea. Some 
interplanetary robotic explorers do return to Earth more or less intact.
 As described before, in the 1970s the Soviet Union launched a series of
 soft-landing Luna Moon probes that drilled up some lunar soil, then 
launched their cargo back to Earth . Small re-entry capsules with 
parachutes then landed the precious material in Soviet territory. More 
recently, NASA's Genesis mission returned a capsule with samples of the 
Sun. Genesis was launched in August 2001 to capture solar wind particles
 expelled by our star with the aid ofultra-pure silicon wafers. These 
wafers were designed to catch, slow down and contain the solar particles
 without damaging them. Scientists are very interested in these 
particles, because they can give vital information on the composition of
 the Sun, and thus on the origins of the Solar System. The wafers were 
very fragile, and the mission's engineers feared that even a relatively 
soft landing under parachutes would damage them. They came up with a 
plan to hire stunt pilots to snatch the capsule out of the air with 
helicopters, each equipped with a special hook. The hook would catch the
 parachute lines, after which the helicopter could gently put the 
Genesis capsule on the ground. More or less the same principle had been 
used in the 1960s for Corona spy satellite capsules secretly returning 
with film full of pictures of Soviet territory. The Genesis capsule 
returned to Earth at exactly the planned time and location, but 
unfortunately its parachutes failed to open. Horrified scientists and 
engineers watched the sample return capsule tumble down and smack into 
Utah soil at 320 kilometers (200 miles) per hour. Lying on the ground, 
cracked open, the spacecraftsomewhat resembled a crashed flying saucer. 
Most of the wafers were all smashed up and contaminated by pieces of 
spacecraft and Utah dust. Nevertheless, NASA has been able to salvage 
some ofthe captured solar particles, so the mission is not a complete 
failure. Investigating the accident , NASA and Genesis prime contractor 
Lockheed Martin discovered that a simple blunder had prevented the 
parachutes from opening. A gravity switch, meant to trigger the 
deployment of a drogue chute to stabilize and decelerate the capsule, 
had been placed upside down. As the switch never activated the drogue, 
the main parachutes could not be deployed. NASA had another spacecraft 
built by Lockheed Martin heading home: 239<br>
<br>
 Chapter 8 the Stardust spacecraft with its return capsule full of comet
 dust particles emitted by other stars. Stardust used the same type of 
capsule and parachute subsystem as Genesis. However, this time the 
essential gravity switch had been properly installed and the precious 
cargo landed softly and safely in January 2006.<br>
<br>
IN A BLAZE OF GLORY Interplanetary spacecraft often end their useful 
lives substantially more honorably than Earth-orbiting satellites. 
NASA's Pathfinder Marslander, for instance, was renamed Sagan Memorial 
Station, after the deceased scientist and space promoter Carl Sagan. It 
thus lives on as a fitting monument on another planet. The camera of the
 automatic lunar lander Surveyor 3 was returned to Earth by the Apollo 
12 crew that landed close to it. Amazingly, engineers investigating it 
found it contained a streptococcus bacterium that had survived over 2.5 
years on the Moon! It had probably been sneezed into the camera by a 
technician with a cold. The famous camera can now be seen in the 
Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC. For some spacecraft,
 the arrival at their destination means that their (planned) end follows
 soon. Such was the fate of the Huygens probe that parachuted down into 
Titan's atmosphere, or the Ranger probes that were sent to crash on the 
Moon in order to make low-altitude photographs . However, others are 
sent on a spectacular finale even though their main mission did not 
require it. The first deliberately crashed operating spacecraft was 
NASA's Magellan Venus radar mapper. As described before, in 1994 
sustained aerobraking caused its mission to end with a dramatic plunge 
to the planet's surface. The purpose was to gather data on Venus's 
atmosphere. Described in the previous chapter, NASA's Lunar Prospector 
was a small moon orbiter launched in 1998. It had a very successful 
mission of a year, during which it mapped the entire Moon and made 
detailed investigations ofits surface composition. The probe then got a 
life extension ofhalf a year for more detailed examinations from a lower
 orbit, circling at an altitude of only 30 kilometers (19 miles) above 
the lunar surface. Nevertheless, in July 1999 all its work was done. 
Instead of being abandoned in lunar orbit, the little probe was given 
one more task that would abruptly end its mission: it was to crash on 
the south pole of the Moon. 240<br>
<br>
 Death of a Spacecraft<br>
<br>
The impact was hoped to eject water-ice thought to be hidden in the deep
 south pole craters, so that it could be detected by telescopes on Earth
 . Lunar Prospector hit right on the mark, but unfortunately no traces 
of water were seen by Earth-based observers. Whether the spacecraft went
 down into the wrong crater or whether there is just no water-ice on the
 Moon is unknown. Future lunar explorers will have to deal with this 
question. Another successful spacecraft that ended its mission in a 
sudden but useful way was Galileo. Deployed from a Space Shuttle in 
1989, it reached Jupiter in December 1995 and conducted detailed 
investigations of the largest planet in the Solar System. It observed 
its atmosphere, magnetosphere and its moons and sent us beautiful 
pictures of this far away world.<br>

 antenna on top (seenfolded here) did not deploy properly, Calileo's 
mission was a huge success. [NA SA]<br>
<br>
241<br>
<br>
 Chapter 8 Although the parabolic umbrella antenna failed to open after 
launch, workarounds were developed to have Galilee send its data via a 
less powerful antenna with a lower gain. New data compression techniques
 made it possible for the spacecraft to send its pictures in a smarter 
way than originally foreseen, such as leaving out all the black space 
areas in the images. Even without the use ofits main antenna , all the 
mission's science objectives were eventually met . After eight years of 
cruising the Jovian system, Galilee's propellant was finally depleted . 
The spacecraft had to be destroyed, because of the possibility that 
Jupiter's uneven gravitational field would gradually change its orbit in
 such a way that it would crash on the moon Europa. If that happened, it
 might biologically contaminate it, and disturb future missions 
searching for indigenous life. Europa is considered to be one of the 
places in our Solar System where life may possibly have evolved, as its 
icy surface may be hiding a global ocean ofliquid water, possibly 
containing organic material. Galileo was therefore maneuvered to burn up
 in Jupiter's atmosphere on September 21, 2003. At 48 kilometers (30 
miles) per second it dived down into the swirling clouds. The spacecraft
 continued transmitting data at least until it passed behind the limb 
ofJupiter, at which point it was 9,283 kilometers (5,768 miles) above 
the I-bar atmospheric layer (because it is a gas planet that, as far as 
we know, has no solid surface, you cannot measure altitude above ground 
at Jupiter) . Engineers had expected Galilee's electronics to be 
disrupted as a result of the high radiation environment so close to 
Jupiter, but the venerable spacecraft worked until the end. The result 
was some data on pressures and densities in Jupiter's atmosphere. The 
Cassini spacecraft that is currently orbiting Saturn may await a similar
 fate. Once the real mission is over, scientist can take a lot more risk
 with their expensive probe, and even send it on kamikaze missions. 
Other than diving into Saturn, it may however also be steered into orbit
 around Titan. Moving it in closer and closer, it would give scientists 
another opportunity to get a good look at the moon's atmosphere. 
Cassini's mission would then end with a plunge into the murky Titan 
atmosphere and a fiery finale by burning up. Another possibility is a 
flight across the rings of Saturn, probably through the open area called
 the Cassini Division. The rings are not very thick , but the chance 
that the spacecraft would hit a piece of rock or ice is relatively high,
 even in the nearly empty division. If Cassini survives, it may then 
still be sent into the atmosphere of Saturn or Titan. Alternatively, 
Cassini may await a completely new mission: if sufficient 242<br>

 Death of a Spacecraft amounts of propellant have remained, it could be 
boosted away from the Saturn system to meet a comet or asteroid.<br>
<br>
SAVING SOHO In June 1998 contact with the Solar and Heliospheric 
Observatory (SOHO) - the joint project ofESA and NASA for studying the 
Sun - was suddenly lost. In its stable Lagrangian point, the spacecraft 
had apparently somehow gotten into a position that prevented its 
antennas being pointed to Earth . Later investigations showed what had 
happened . SOHO's attitude control uses three gyroscope units to tell 
its attitude with respect to the Sun and Earth: Gyros A, Band C. Gyro A 
is meant to be used in "safe mode, " the mode of operations to which the
 spacecraft automatically turns when something is wrong. Gyro B is used 
to detect faults in the attitude control, and Gyro C is for routine 
attitude control. The problems started with an erroneous software patch 
that was sent to SOHO and installed on its onboard computer. The new 
computer program accidentally allowed the critically important Gyro A to
 be deactivated, minimizing "wear and tear" in order to conserve its 
operational life. After a routine maneuver using all gyros, SOHO's 
computer detected that Gyro B was giving false readings. The computer 
thus automatically put SOHO in safe mode and switched attitude control 
from the normally used Gyro C to the "trouble shooting" Gyro A. The 
error in Gyro B was then corrected and SOHO tried to re-align it with 
the readings from Gyro A. However, Gyro A had just been deactivated by a
 command from the erroneous software. Now Gyro B implied that the 
spacecraftwas rotating, while Gyro A implied that it was standing still.
 By firing its thrusters to change the roll velocity, SOHO desperately 
tried to move itself so that both gyros would indicate the same speed 
and thus be re-aligned. Unfortunately this could never work, because 
Gyro A was turned off and thus indicated zero roll velocity no matter 
how the spacecraft was actually moving. After two hours the confused 
spacecraft gave up and put itself into safe mode again. Operators on the
 ground saw from the data sent by SOHO that Gyro A indicated no roll 
velocity, while Gyro B said it was rotating. Not knowing that Gyro A was
 not working and basing themselves on previous safe mode experiences, 
they decided that Gyro B had to be malfunctioning. 243<br>
<br>
 Chapter 8 Turning Gyro B off, they left SOHO without any working 
gyroscopic unit. Losing direction, the spacecraft was no longer able to 
point its main, high-gain antenna to Earth and its solar arrays to the 
Sun. As a result, control of SOHO was, abruptly and unexpectedly, lost. 
Frantic signaling by the powerful antenna dishes of NASA's Deep Space 
Network did not manage to re-establish contact with the lost satellite. 
Then the international rescue team, quickly formed after the loss of 
contact, concocted the idea of using the world's largest antenna, the 
giant Arecibo radio telescope. This enormous, 305-meter (l,OOO-foot) 
diameter dish built into a natural valley on Puerto Rico was used to 
transmit a powerful signal to SOHO. NASA's large Goldstone antenna was 
then used to listen for signals returned by the spacecraft, as the 
basically stationary Arecibo could not be pointed to the spacecraftfor 
very long and only had a transmitter installed at that time. To the 
relief of the operators, a faint heartbeat of SOHO was finally received.
 SOHO signaled that it was slowly spinning and out of battery power 
because the solar arrays were pointed in the wrong direction. Without 
power, the heating system had shut down and the thruster's propellant 
had frozen. The operators then instructed SOHO to use every bit of 
available power to slowly thaw out the propulsion subsystem. 
Unfortunately, every time the batteries were recharging the onboard 
computer had to be turned off and the software patch containing the new 
power management instructions was lost from its memory. The software 
thus had to be re-sent and re-installed every time power levels 
increased sufficiently to wake up the computer. Mter two weeks 
offine-tuning, the rescuers finally managed to thaw all the propellant 
to enable the thrusters to be used for attitude control again. SOHO was 
then re-pointed in the right direction, and normal operations were 
finally resumed. Even though the scientific instruments and other vital 
onboard equipment had been exposed to temperatures varying from -120 to 
+100 degrees Celsius (-184 to +212 degrees Fahrenheit) because of the 
inoperative thermal control subsystem, all except the gyros had survived
 the ordeal undamaged. The delicate wiring ofthe gyroscopes had not been
 able to cope with the extremes and could no longer be used. Fortunately
 the engineers and operators found a way to stabilize the 
spacecraftwithout the gyros, using only the other sensors on board that 
could still work. Thanks to the ingenuity of the people involved, SOHO 
was saved, and is still operating today.<br>

 Death of a Spacecraft<br>
<br>
HOPE IS LOST Sometimes spacecraft are lost despite valiant and daring 
attempts to save them. Such is the story of the Japanese Nozomi; a bit 
sad, but also a testimony to the ingenuity of the Japanese space 
scientists and engineers. On July 4, 1998, Japan became the third nation
 ever, after the United States and the Soviet Union, to send a 
spacecraft to Mars. The probe was called Planet-B, but renamed Nozomi 
after its launch from Japan's Kagoshima Space Center. Nozomi means 
"Hope" in Japanese, and hope would soon be needed. Its M-S launcher was 
not powerful enough to speed the spacecraft toward Mars, so Nozomi first
 went into a long, elliptical Earth orbit that took it around the Moon. N
 ozomi completed two lunar swingbys to gather speed, then left the 
Earth-Moon system and entered an orbit around the Sun. To further 
increase its velocity, Nozomi was to make a gravity-assist flyby ofEarth
 together with a 7-minute bum of its bipropellant engine on December 20,
 1998. Disappointingly, however, a valve malfunctioned and precious 
propellant was lost, but most importantly Nozomi did not receive a 
sufficient boost to reach Mars. In an attempt to get things back on 
track, controllers at Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical 
Sciences (ISAS) activated Nozomi's thrusters for a correction maneuver 
on December 21. Unfortunately, the bum emptied the tanks so much that 
not enough propellant was left for the later required braking maneuver 
near Mars. Without braking, Nozomi would just speed past the planet 
instead of going into orbit around it. The situation looked bleak. 
Nevertheless , the ground controllers found a way to save the mission. 
They formulated a new flight plan according to which Nozomi would make 
three trips around the Sun and two additional Earth flybys. These 
gravity assists from the Sun and Earth would give Nozomijust the right 
velocity to reach the red planet by 2004, with a low enough speed for it
 to go into Mars orbit using only a little bit of braking thrust and 
propellant. The arrivalwould be four years late, but ISAS scientists 
believed that the spacecraft's science instruments would then still work
 properly. Looking on the bright side, they even saw a benefit of the 
longer flight: there would be extra time to investigate the solar wind 
in interplanetary space. Then, in April 2002, the radio went down due to
 a massive solar flare that damaged the onboard communications and power
 subsystems. Such powerful energy outbursts from the Sun send charged 
particles into space, which can cause radio and electrical disruptions 
even on Earth. 245<br>
<br>
 Chapter 8 Fortunately, some contact with the spacecraft was still 
possible and the probe's computer was not damaged. Engineers were 
eventually able to fix the problem with the communication subsystem. 
However, the solar flare had also created an electrical short that had 
damaged the attitude control heating, which allowed the hydrazine 
propellant to freeze. The propellant thawed out when Nozomi got closer 
to the Sun for an Earth flyby in December 2002, and the thrusters could 
be used to correct its trajectory. Another Earth flyby in June 2003 also
 worked well. However, as it approached Mars five years behind schedule 
and with nearly empty tanks, the hydrazine froze again due to the 
increased distance from the Sun. When Nozomi finally reached its 
destination, it was thus unable to fire its attitude control thrusters 
and larger main thruster to move into an orbit around Mars. Instead, 
Nozomi flew on and got stuck in a long, useless orbit around the Sun. It
 was a sad ending to Nozomi's interesting but tragic life.<br>
<br>
NEAR EROS In February 2000, NASA's Near-Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)
 probe became the first spacecraft ever to go into orbit around an 
asteroid. NEAR spent a year studying the irregularly shaped, 
33-kilometer-Iong (21-mile-Iong) asteroid Eros, then its main job was 
done. The spacecraft's operators came up with a daring and exciting plan
 that would result in a scientific bonus and a new space record : 
landing NEAR, as the first machine ever, on the surface of an asteroid! 
The spacecraft had not been designed for this, but the extremely low 
gravity of Eros would be a great help; rather than a genuine landing, 
the feat would be more like docking with another, very large, object in 
space. The probe was brought down closer and closer to the surface, all 
the time making ever more detailed pictures. On February 12, 2001, NEAR 
Shoemaker made a gentle, perfect three-point landing on the tips of two 
solar panels and an edge ofthe spacecraft body. The touchdown velocity 
was only about 6.5 kilometers (4 miles) per hour, low enough to prevent 
the probe from bouncing back into space. The touchdown was so elegant 
that NEAR was stilloperating and communicating with Earth even after 
landing. To benefit from this unexpected opportunity for even more bonus
 science, the operating team got a 10-day mission extension and then a 
further four days of Deep Space Network ground antenna time to collect 
all the data sent back to Earth.<br>
<br>

<br>
The extension allowed NEAR's gamma-ray spectrometer to collect data from
 its new, favorable position so close to the surface. The instrument's 
team quickly redesigned the necessary software and uploaded it to the 
spacecraft. Never before had a gamma-ray experiment operated on the 
actual surface of another planet. The result was very detailed readings 
of the composition of the asteroid's surface, enabling a much better 
comparison with some meteorites found on Earth that are thought to have 
originated from asteroids. NEAR Shoemaker now sits silently just south 
of a saddle-shaped feature named Himeros, a lasting monument to the 
ingenuity and adaptability of human intellect.<br>

HE opportunities for new scientific discoveries in the Solar System 
remain boundless. We will continue to send out new, more efficient 
robotic explorers incorporating exciting new technology with 
ever-increasing capabilities. We will use them to visit new worlds as 
well as revisit places we've already had a glimpse of, to see them in 
new ways and learn much more . We are going to build spacecraft that can
 do more science for the same sizes, masses and power levels of our 
current spacecraft. In parallel, we will develop robots that can do the 
same amount of exploration with much smaller systems than we are using 
now. Our mechanical adventurers will investigate regions on planets and 
moons that were inaccessible for earlier spacecraft, and they will be 
more adaptive to changing situations. Some new developments are the 
result ofa "requirement pull"; they are undertaken to reach a certain 
specified goal. The technology of the Apollo Moon program is a clear 
example of this: to fulfill president Kennedy's proclamation "oflanding a
 man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth," NASA and US 
industries had to invent new moonsuits, lunar 249<br>
<br>
 Chapter 9 landers, rocket motors, smaller onboard computers and much 
more. A current requirement pull is the ongoing development of new 
launcher technology in a quest to make access to space cheaper. However,
 more often new space projects are a result of a "technology push"; new 
inventions making it possible to do robotic space missions faster, 
better or cheaper. The fast progress in miniaturization and increased 
sensitivity of all kinds of electronic detectors has for instance 
resulted in new scientific instruments that are much better and yet 
smaller than those launched 10 years ago. And these were in turn already
 a big improvement over the instruments flown on board spacecraft in the
 1980s. Modern instruments can make more detailed observations than 
earlier versions, but we need more stable satellites to fully benefit 
from the improved capabilities. This means the AOCS (Altitude and Orbit 
Control System) equipment needs to be more accurate. Furthermore, 
because of the increased amount of detail that the instruments are able 
to see, they collect larger amounts of data. In turn, this requires 
improvements in the Data Handling subsystem. Due to this kind 
ofprocesses, interplanetary spacecraft on the whole are improved 
continually; each new mission is a step forward in science as well as in
 technology. Nowadays the "pushing" technology often comes from 
non-space areas. For instance, commercial computer technology has made 
quantum leaps in the last 20 years or so; spacecraft processors are now 
based on home PC technology and not the other way around . The computer 
currently sitting on your desk is likely to be a generation or two more 
advanced than those flying on the newest space probes, because it takes 
time to adapt commercial equipment for use in the radiation and vacuum 
of space. Likewise, the development of revolutionary, air-breathing 
engines for efficient, reusable launchers is more likely to come from 
the aircraft industry than from the traditional launcher developers. It 
is always hard to forecast the future, but nevertheless this chapter 
attempts to provide a glimpse of what may come. Space agencies, 
industries, research institutes and universities are constantly seeking 
out new technologies and inventing innovative spacecraft concepts. There
 is much more going on than can be captured within the pages of this 
book. Some possibilities may become reality soon, some will require long
 periods of further development, and other dreams may never be 
fulfilled. However, for every vision of science and technology that 
fails to materialize, several as yet unforeseen possibilities will 
arise. 250<br>
<br>
 A Bright Future<br>
<br>
FASTER, BETTER AND CHEAPER? The trouble with space exploration is that 
we always want to launch more probes with ever more complex instruments.
 But as the budgets available are very limited, tough choices have to be
 made on what missions should be on top of the wish-list and what 
missions, however interesting, need to be forsaken to free money for the
 selected few. Then, at the level of individual projects, more 
cost-related decisions must be made: Can we afford the scientifically 
most capable design, or do we have to go for a less preferred but much 
cheaper option? How much science can we shave off to save cost without 
dramatically impairing the value of the mission? Often the version of 
the space probe that actually gets launched is a lot leaner than the 
dream-machine presented in the first engineering concept drawings. In 
the early 1990s the then head of NASA, Dan Goldin, launched the now 
infamous "Faster, Better, Cheaper" initiative. According to this edict, 
NASA would from then on aim to develop spacecraft in less time, with 
better capabilities, and for lower costs than ever before. There would 
be strict schedule and cost constraints, a maximum use of already 
existing equipment and a minimization of management-oversight. The 
concept started off well, with very successful missions such as Mars 
Pathfinder and NEAR Shoemaker being launched shortly after starting the 
development, and for relatively low budgets. But then a series of 
disasters followed. In 1997 the Earth satellite Lewis went spinning out 
ofcontrol soon after launch, due to a flawed attitude control subsystem.
 Unable to point its solar arrays to the Sun, it could not recharge its 
batteries and was lost. One and a half years later the WIRE infrared 
astronomy satellite also ran into serious trouble shortly after orbit 
insertion . The cover of its telescope ejected prematurely, making the 
solid hydrogen that was to act as coolant evaporate rapidly. The venting
 made WIRE spin out ofcontrol, and without proper cooling it was unable 
to measure the weak heatradiation of stars it was supposed to detect. In
 the same year, Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander were lost 
within a few months of each other, both due to apparently simple but 
crucial mistakes that could have been avoided with a bit more testing 
and project supervision. Part of the "Faster, Better, Cheaper" plan had 
been the acceptance of higher risks to bring costs down. NASA had 
assumed that the higher number of successful missions flown would 
compensate for the few 251<br>
<br>
 Chapter 9 additional disappointments. However, more spacecraft were 
lost than expected, and many due to apparently simple and basic 
mistakes. The series of failures sent waves of anxiety throughout NASA 
and the space industry. Various investigation boards concluded that the 
push for low costs and short schedules had crossed a critical limit. 
Developing teams were simply not given enough time and money to do their
 work properly. A study of The Aerospace Corporation plotted the 
relative complexity of space missions against the amount ofmoney and 
time available for their development, and showed that all the recently 
failed missions were in the "danger zone." The projects had been too 
complex to be developed within the very limited timeframes and financial
 budgets allocated by NASA . As a result, the designing engineers got 
stressed, the technicians didn't have enough time for all the tests 
required and the project management lacked the resources to properly 
check everything that was being done. The final verdict was that the new
 missions had been done too quickly and too cheaply. The current 
consensus in the space industry is that out ofthe three goals in the 
"Faster, Better, Cheaper" list, you can only get two at the same time. 
You can do a mission faster and better, if you are willing to put 
additional money into it. Alternatively, you can develop your space 
probe cheaper and faster ifyou are willing to trade on its capabilities.
 Or you do it both better and cheaper, but you allow more development 
time. But as Meat Loaf sings, "Two out of three ain't bad." However, in a
 more reasonable form the "Faster, Better, Cheaper" concept still 
survives. Rather than do only a couple of extremely complex missions per
 decade, NASA and ESA are now launching many more smaller missions based
 on greater amounts of standardized equipment. Nearly every two years, 
when the planetary alignments are favorable , NASA is sending a probe to
 Mars. Furthermore, over the last couple of years ESA has been launching
 a record number of interplanetary spacecraft, and it has been able to 
do that despite shrinking science mission budgets. It has never been 
busier in interplanetary space!<br>

company property robots are already exploring the Solar System on a 
grand scale, establishing<br>
<br>
252<br>
<br>
 A Bright Future mining bases along the way and capturing asteroids full
 of precious metals to sell to industries on Earth . In reality, space 
exploration is still the exclusive domain of government agencies, and 
private business has remained stuck in Earth orbit. While commercial 
companies are operating some Earth observation satellites and most of 
the world's telecommunications satellites, the vast majority of missions
 to the Moon and further have been strictly government-funded and 
government-operated. This is not very surprising. With a telecom 
satellite, investors can get a nice profit within a couple of years. 
However, scientific data from a spacecraft orbiting Jupiter can only be 
sold to a relatively small group of rather poor scientists and 
budget-constrained space agencies. And even then, only many years after 
the initial investment. Moreover, planetary exploration requires very 
complex, often unique equipment specially developed for a certain 
mission. In contrast, most commercial Earth orbiting satellites are 
based on existing and standard space equipment. A telecommunications 
satellite can be put in operation within a few years after order, while 
the development of planetary robot explorers usually takes much longer, 
requires much more money and involves a lot more technical and financial
 risk. No wonder private investors put their money in telecom and Earth 
observation satellites rather than try to make a meager, late and very 
uncertain profit by launching risky planetary explorers. Apart from 
developing spacecraft under government contracts, there does not seem to
 be much commercial opportunity in space exploration at the moment. Even
 if you could manage to find a patch of the Moon covered with bricks of 
gold, it would not be worth the investment of building and flying a 
spacecraft to scoop it up and bring it back to Earth . The costs would 
far outweigh the value of the gold. Nevertheless, there may be some 
near-term niche-markets for innovative space missions beyond Earth orbit
 . For instance, Californiabased TransOrbital Inc. is a private company 
that is developing a lunar probe called Trailblazer. Funding and running
 the project is completely independent of any government agency. 
Instead, the mission is sponsored by a number of companies that are 
mostly in it for the advertisement possibilities. Computer manufacturer 
Hewlett Packard, for instance, will supply the onboard computer for the 
Trailblazer spacecraft. It wants to use the project to advertise its new
 wireless computer technology that will enable Trailblazer's computer to
 be in contact with all the equipment on board via a radio link. It will
 also make it possible for anyone with the right<br>
<br>
253<br>
<br>
 Chapter 9 hand-held computer to send e-mails to the spacecraft while it
 is orbiting the Moon, and to get a confirmation that their message has 
arrived (what the spacecraft will do with the e-mails is not clear, 
however). It is even more extraordinary that many private persons also 
finance the mission by paying money to put all kinds of small personal 
items on board the spacecraft. Sending a small message to the Moon on 
Trailblazer costs you $17, launching a business card costs you $2,500 , 
while for anything else you will need to put down $2,500 per gram. There
 is room for some 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of personal items on board 
Trailblazer. Thousands of people have already taken advantage of this 
unique possibility, making the initiative an important part of the 
financing of the mission. The whole project is estimated to cost about 
$20 million, including launch . Trailblazer weighs only a mere 110 
kilograms (240 pounds), which makes it light enough to be launched with a
 cheap, Russian Dnepr rocket. The Dneprs are former nuclear ballistic 
missiles that have to be destroyed according to new arms-control 
treaties. Rather than simply scrapping the original Soviet SS-18 
rockets, they are converted to Dnepr space rockets and commercially sold
 for launching small satellites (nuclear warhead not included, of 
course). A smart move: with a launch price of only 8 million dollar they
 are rather cheap, Russia gets rid of its missiles without having to pay
 for scrapping them, and its military launch teams can continue to 
practice launching rockets. After launch the can-shaped, 
rotation-stabilized Trailblazer will orbit the Moon for about three 
months in a very low orbit. Its camera will make highresolution pictures
 of the lunar surface that TransOrbital intends to sell to scientific 
institutes. Additional revenue could come from a new lunar map, based on
 the Trailblazer images. This will have the highest resolution ever and 
could help spaceagencies and private firms to plan future lunar 
missions. Apart from stills, Trailblazer will make HDTV-quality videos 
to be sold for use in documentaries and television commercials. 
Trailblazer will also try to image the sites of the Apollo landings. 
TransOrbital hopes to find the lower parts of the Lunar Modules that 
stayed behind after the astronauts left, or at least the disturbances of
 the lunar soil caused by the rocket exhaust of the Apollo landers. 
There are still many "conspiracy theory" enthusiasts who claim that the 
Apollo program was an elaborate hoax and that all the moonwalks have 
been staged in a movie study. Pictures ofApollo spacecraft on the Moon 
would silence them, and would therefore be very sellable to NASA and to 
newspapers and magazines. 254<br>
<br>
 A Bright Future<br>
<br>
The gravitational field of the Moon is rather uneven, due to mass 
concentrations of denser rock, called "mascons," associated with the 
dark, basalt-filled impact basins such as Mare Imbrium. This will 
eventually disturb the low orbit of Trailblazer so much that it will 
fall down and crash on the Moon. All the personal items on board will be
 packed inside a crashresistant capsule that is expected to bury itself 4
 to 5 meters (15 feet) deep inside the lunar soil upon impact. There the
 messages, business cards, letters, hairs and other items will remain 
until found by some future lunar explorers. Not everyone is happy with 
the Trailblazer initiative. Some environmentalists are concerned about 
the Moon becoming polluted. Without an atmosphere and erosion, the metal
 skeletons ofdiscarded spacecraftand the scarsofimpacts will remain 
visible for millions ofyears. They are objecting to the plan to crash 
Trailblazer just to put some souvenirs on the Moon. In reaction, the US 
State Department has listed some requirements on the mission to minimize
 the pollution of the Moon. It has also decided that TransOrbital is 
compliant with these requirements, making Trailblazer the first ever 
privately organized interplanetary mission approved by the State 
Department. Apart from the plans of TransOrbital, it is pretty quiet on 
the front of private interplanetary missions. In 2000 another company, 
LunaCorp, got $1 million in backing from the Radio Shack chain of 
electronics shops. LunaCorp is developing a robotic spacecraft that 
would be assembled at the International Space Station and from there 
launched to the Moon. Like Trailblazer, it would generate 
high-resolution pictures and video and involve public participation. 
However, the project is still looking for further funding to continue 
the development. They also have a plan to develop a small rover that the
 general public could drive by remote control. Needless to say this is 
much more complicated than putting a relatively simple satellite in 
orbit around the Moon. In the 1990s, Dutch astronaut Wubbo Ockels was 
leading an ESA project for a Moonlander that would have been partly 
funded by private sponsors and the general public. However, budget 
constraints put an end to that innovative plan. Although some small 
companies like TransOrbital and LunaCorp may find ways to do 
interplanetary exploration cheaper and faster than NASA and ESA, as long
 as spaceflight equipment and especially launches are prohibitively 
expensive their efforts are likely to remain rather limited. 
Complicated, expensive projects with long development schedules such as 
Cassini and Rosetta are likely to remain the exclusive domain of 
government space agencies for a long time.<br>

FUTURE LAUNCHERS One reason why interplanetary missions are so expensive
 is the cost of launching. At the moment the only way to put 
interplanetary probes in space is by putting them on top of large, 
conventional rockets. Launch prices for these vehicles are very high, 
because they can only be used once . The Space Shuttle, even though it 
is partly reusable, is even more expensive. In general, a launch gobbles
 up about a quarter to a third of the total financial budget for a 
robotic space exploration mission. At some time in the future we may use
 more efficient, fully reusable rocket vehicles like spaceplanes to put 
things in orbit at lower costs. Ideally, such a vehicle would not 
throwaway rocket stages on its way up, but fly into space and come back 
in one piece. Upon return, it should be able be relaunched in a short 
time, after only a minimum amount of maintenance. Something like a large
 Space Shuttle Orbiter without the large external propellant tank and 
rocket boosters, commuting between the Earth and space like a true 
aerospace plane. Unfortunately such ideal vehicles are very difficult to
 build. They need to have extremely light structures to be able to make 
it into orbit without the benefit of losing weight on the way up by 
jettisoning empty stages. Moreover, they require very sophisticated 
engines that are a mix ofjet and rocket technology, and advanced thermal
 protection materials for fully reusable, low-maintenance heatshields. 
Most space agencies and major launcher industries are more or less 
seriously developing such vehicles. In 2004, NASA successfully tested 
the X-43A, an almost 4-meter-Iong (13-foot-Iong) uncrewed, air-breathing
 vehicle that uses oxygen from the atmosphere to achieve high speeds. On
 its last flight, in November 2004, it reached a velocity of 9.6 times 
the speed of sound! Such velocities are sufficient to compress the air 
in the engine without the need for any moving mechanisms, as in a 
regular jet engine. Spaceplanes with such engines, called scramjets, 
could use atmospheric oxygen during a large part of their flight to 
orbit, and thus would need to take less oxygen with them than normal 
rockets. Unfortunately, scramjets only work at hypersonic velocities; at
 speeds lower than five times the speed of sound (Mach 5) the air does 
not get compressed sufficiently for efficient combustion and propulsion.
 A revolution in space transportation may be coming, but it will take 
some time before truly cheap access to space with efficient, fully 
reusable launchers will be available. However, there are other 
possibilities for launching items away from 256<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
Earth . For instance, you could use a powerful cannon to shoot your 
spacecraft into space. During the Second World War Germany developed a 
super-gun, named "Vergeltung 3" (Vengeance 3) or "V3", to shoot 
projectiles to England from the coast of France. The V3 consisted of a 
long barrel with many side chambers containing explosives. Rather than 
accelerating the projectile with one powerful explosion, the relatively 
small side chamber charges along the barrel were ignited as the 
projectile sped past, each time adding a kick to increase the velocity. 
Fortunately the super-guns were detected by reconnaissance airplanes 
while still under construction, and were bombed into oblivion before 
they could be made operational. In the mid-1960s a Canadian engineer, 
Gerald Bull, used Navy guns with 40-centimeter (16-inch) diameter 
barrels to shoot small projectiles to high altitudes under the US Army's
 High Altitude Research Program, HARP. The "Martlet" projectiles his 
team developed incorporated solid propellant rocket engines that were 
ignited after they left the guns, to get them even higher than the gun 
alone could shoot them. Some 300 shots were fired, and the Martlets 
attained a maximum altitude of285 kilometers (177 miles), well into 
space (although not fast enough to go into orbit). 257<br>
<br>
 Chapter 9 Many new technologies were developed for HARP, such as 
sensors, electronics, batteries and even attitude control systems that 
could withstand the extreme accelerations of the gun launches. HARP was 
stopped for political reasons; the Canadian government discontinued its 
support of the program, and because Bull was Canadian the US Army could 
not continue to fund his project on its own . Moreover, any weapon 
covering a larger distance than 96 kilometers (60 miles) was supposed to
 be under the control of the US Air Force, not the Army . Disillusioned,
 Bull "gave in to the Dark Side" and instead offered his expertise to 
countries such as South Africa, China and Iraq. Probably because of 
this, he was shot and killed in Brussels in 1990, only few weeks before 
parts of a super-gun destined for Iraq were intercepted in England . The
 assassin was never found. After the first Gulf War that soon followed, 
UN inspectors found two partly completed super-guns in Iraq. It is very 
likely that Bull had designed these cannons and was killed to prevent 
him from continuing his developments; Iraq could have used a finished 
Bull gun to bombard Israel with projectiles full of toxic gas. Moreover,
 Bull was apparently helping to improve the accuracy of Iraqi ballistic 
missiles, which would not have helped to increase his popularity outside
 Iraq. Despite its dark past, super-gun technology could be used 
peacefully to launch spacecraft. The problem is the extremely high 
accelerations inside the barrel of the gun , equivalent to over 1,000 
times the projectile's weight. Normal launchers only expose their cargos
 to accelerations of about six times their weight, or 6 "g," so 
conventional spacecraft would be completely squashed to a pancake 
configuration by the extreme acceleration of such a gun launch . Only 
very dense systems that basically cannot be compressed any further can 
survive launch by a cannon. The development ofsuch equipment is not 
impossible: electronics and cameras used in military missiles can handle
 hundreds ofg's, and the technology developed for HARP could handle over
 10,000 g. Nevertheless, most of the usual spacecraft equipment 
currently in use could not withstand such accelerations. Moreover, to 
attain the required orbital speed of at least 7.8 kilometers (4.8 miles)
 per second, a gun launch with conventional explosives would not be 
sufficient. The projectile would need at least two additional rocket 
stages to further increase its speed, and even then the useful payload 
would not be more than about a kilogram . Only very small, compact 
"pico"satellites could potentially be launched with an advanced but 
conventional super-gun system.<br>
<br>
258<br>
<br>
 A Bright Future<br>
<br>
However, instead ofwith explosions, projectiles could also be launched 
with the use of very strong electromagnetic fields. An electromagnetic 
launch gun would use powerful magnetic repulsion forces, generated by 
strong electric currents, to push and accelerate projectiles along a 
rail. Such systems can potentially achieve higher velocities and launch 
heavier projectiles than traditional gun technology. Apart from 
launching small rockets and satellites, electromagnetic rail guns could 
assist the launch oflarger, more conventional rocket vehicles. A 
spaceplane accelerated on a electromagnetically powered rail system 
would get a modest but useful initial kick, and thus require less 
propellant to get into orbit . The downside is that even a small 
electromagnetic launch system requires very high electrical power levels
 and very long barrels or rails. Moreover, it means that the vehicle 
will already have a very high velocity at low altitude, where the 
atmosphere is very dense and the aerodynamic drag is thus high. 
Potentially useful for launching much heavier spacecraft are nuclear 
fission rockets. At the end of the 1950s American scientists working on 
nuclear weapons developed a method of launching a giant spaceship by 
detonating a series of atomic bombs under it. This "Orion" spaceship was
 supposed to fly astronauts to the Moon, Mars and even the moons of 
Jupiter and Saturn in the late 1960s and early 1970s. With intervals of 
less than a second, Orion would shoot out hundreds of small nuclear 
bombs at the back. These bombs would then explode some distance behind 
the ship, propelling Orion by hitting a special bumper shield, the 
so-called "pusher plate," with bomb debris. Giant shock absorbers would 
connect the pusher plate to the rest of the ship to smooth out the 
pulses of thrust generated by the explosions. After initial interest by 
the Air Force and NASA , the project soon lost support because of the 
huge leap in technology that would be required . Moreover, the public 
and politicians became increasingly sensitive to exploding nuclear 
weapons in the atmosphere; launching Orions from the Earth's surface 
would have resulted in serious amounts of deadly radioactive fallout. 
The designers came up with an alternative plan to launch smaller Orions 
with Saturn V rockets into Earth orbit and have them start their trip to
 Mars or beyond from there. However, at the time NASA was already 
working on another nuclear propulsion concept called NERVA, and thought 
Orion was'a step beyond that, for later in the future. The only other 
potential customer, the US Air Force, liked the idea of a giant nuclear 
spaceship but could not suggest a credible military role for its use.

Time caught up with Orion and the project was abandoned. The concept may
 be resurrected at some point in the future, but certainly only for use 
far away from Earth. NERVA was a more modest and realistic US nuclear 
fission propulsion project. During the 1960s and 1970s experiments were 
performed on NERVA nuclear fission rockets in the United States, 
primarily for use in crewed spacecraft bound for Mars. Energy from a 
nuclear generator was used to heat hydrogen gas to extremely high 
temperatures. The hydrogen was then expelled through a conventional 
rocket nozzle. NERVA's concept was proven to work and the technology is 
quite mature, but the work has been all but abandoned . Soon after the 
last Apollo Moon missions, it was decided that no astronauts would be 
sent to Mars in the near future, so NERVA's power was no longer needed. 
Anyway, it is very unlikely that nuclear fission rockets will ever be 
allowed to operate within the Earth's atmosphere because of the 
radiation pollution risks involved. A nuclear space explorer would 
probably have its reactor launched in small elements; the critical mass 
ofradioactive material needed to start a nuclear reaction would then 
only be achieved when all the pieces are put together in space. Nuclear 
fission is based on processes that generate energy when atoms break 
apart. Instead, nuclear fusion is based on energy radiated by the 
merging of atoms. The Sun works on this principle. Fusion processes 
generate much less harmful radiation and radioactive material than 
nuclear fission, and fusion rockets could thus be a lot safer. However, 
fusion technology development has only just started. No one has yet even
 succeeded in building a nuclear fusion reactor that provides<br>
<br>
260<br>
<br>
 A Bright Future<br>
<br>
more energy than has to be put in to sustain the fusion reaction. The 
time when such reactors are mature enough for use as spacecraft 
propulsion systems, is surely quite some years away. Another very 
interesting technology that has just entered the experimental stage is 
laser propulsion. The idea is to use a ground-based laser to heat 
propellant on board a vehicle, with the resulting superhot gasses being 
expelled through a rocket nozzle. Because of the potentially higher 
exhaust velocity, the vehicle could require much less propellant to 
reach orbit, while all the energy-generating equipment could remain on 
Earth. The downside is that the laser used has to be very powerful, even
 for launching small satellites into orbit . The development of this 
launch concept is therefore limited by the power of the lasers we can 
build today, and this is by far not sufficient to put anything into 
space. In the USA , experiments are performed with small projectiles 
that focus incoming laser light on the air under them. The laser 
basically makes the air explode and this boosts the metal object upward .
 Altitudes of several tens ofmeters have been achieved so far - a 
promising start but only a baby step in comparison to what is needed to 
launch a satellite or interplanetary space probe . An even more exotic 
way to reach orbit is the space elevator concept. According to a NASA 
study, a cable ofan incredibly strong material could be used to connect 
an orbital space station directly with the Earth's surface. The center 
of mass of the system would have to be positioned in Geostationary Earth
 Orbit (GEO), where its orbital rotation is 24 hours and it stays over 
the same point above the equator as the Earth rotates around its axis. 
In any other orbit the system would move too quickly or too slowly and 
break the cable. Electromagnetically suspended elevators or mechanical 
climbers could shuttle between the surface and stations along the cable,
 without the need for any rocket propulsion. Once transported to the 
main hub , at GEO altitude , satellites and space probes could be 
launched directly from the space elevator. As these objects would start 
with the same velocity that the space elevator is traveling at that 
altitude - which is GEO orbital velocity the rocket systems required to 
send spacecraft to the planets would thus be very small. The feasibility
 of the space elevator concept depends mostly on the development of 
materials that can withstand the incredible forces on the cable. Steel 
is too heavy and by far not strong enough. Recently developed nanotube 
materials, based on cylindrical molecules ofcarbon, may make it 
feasible. However, the longest nanotube cables made so far are just 
about a 261<br>
<br>
 Chapter 9 meter long, so we are not yet able to produce the very long 
cables that would be required . Once a space probe has already been 
placed in low Earth orbit by another means of transportation, a system 
of freely orbiting and rotating cables or "tethers" could be used to 
transfer spacecraft to higher orbits. Such a system would consist of a 
very long tether, 100 kilometers (62 miles) or more in length , with a 
ballast mass at one end and a sort of spacecraft catching or docking 
device on the other. As the cable would be in orbit around the Earth, it
 would be spinning like a sling, with its center ofrotation near the 
ballast mass. A spacecraftin a lower orbit could hook itself onto the 
docking end of the tether and let itselfbe swung into a higher orbit . 
With a series of these tethers, or "sky hooks," spacecraft startingjust 
above the atmosphere could be shot all the way into an interplanetary 
orbit. A spacecraft accelerated in this way does so by stealing momentum
 from the tether. By transferring energy to the spacecraft, the tether's
 own orbit is lowered . Eventually, it would fall back down to Earth if 
nothing was done to reboost the system. Restoring the tether's orbit 
could be achieved by lining the long cable with metal wire and passing 
an electric current through it. The electric wire would generate its own
 magnetic field, and the interaction of the wire's magnetic field with 
the Earth's magnetic field would result in a small but steady force that
 could push the tether back up. The power required could be generated by
 solar panels. This concept of generating a force with a cable and a 
current has been tested during a Space Shuttle mission, and was found to
 actually work quite well (except that the cable burned through due to 
an electrical spark).<br>
<br>
SOLAR SAILING Getting space probes out of Earth orbit and accelerating 
them to high speeds to reach distant planets in a reasonable time costs a
 lot ofpropellant. This means big, expensive rockets and large and heavy
 propellant tanks on the spacecraft. To limit launch costs and leave 
enough room for an interesting suite of instruments, most modern 
interplanetary space probes use slingshot planetary flybys to increase 
velocity and change orbit , but that takes a lot of time and can involve
 risky maneuvers. There is, however, another way that may completely 
eliminate the need for rocket propulsion on board a space probe.<br>
<br>
262<br>
<br>
 A Bright Future Some 400 years ago, the famous astronomerJohannes 
Kepler noted that the tails of comets are swept away by some mysterious 
breeze from the Sun. He imagined that it might be possible to use this 
to propel spaceships, the way sailing ships on the ocean are moved by 
the wind. Although Kepler's version of solar wind doesn't really exist, 
we now know that light exerts a tiny force on anything it is reflected 
by. The push is extremely small, less than 1 kilogram force per square 
kilometer (0.8 pound force per square mile). On normal spacecraft it can
 thus be completely neglected, but with a big enough surface it becomes 
significant. A large, ultralight spacecraft with enormous, mirror-like 
solar sails made of extremely thin foil would be able to be pushed 
around the Solar System by Sunlight. Slightly similar to electric 
propulsion, the push would be very, very small but it would act 
continuously, as long as the Sun was close enough and able to shine on 
the sail. Eventually, the continuous force of the light on a solar sail 
could propel a spacecraft to speeds several times faster than is 
possible with traditional rockets. The continuous force of Sunlight 
acting on a solar sail could also be used to put spacecraft into very 
special orbits that are no longer strictly limited to the orbital 
mechanics rules of Newton or Kepler. A solar sail may, for instance, 
hover in a fixed position with respect to the Sun, balancing gravity and
 light pressure forces against each other. Computer simulations show, 
however, that the accurate control of such a solar sail would be very 
tricky. The use of large lasers on Earth to help to push the spacecraft 
could enhance the effectiveness of solar sails, but very powerful lasers
 would be required . Moreover, a laser loses its usefulness over long 
distances because the beam diverges. The major problem with solar 
sailing is how to fold the vast surface of ultra-thin foil in such a way
 that it fits inside the payload fairing of a launcher, and can still be
 deployed without damage once in space. Both NASA and ESA have made some
 deployment tests of small solar sails on Earth, and are studying 
demonstration missions to test deployment in Earth orbit . The Planetary
 Society, an organization of space enthusiasts in the USA, has already 
attempted to launch such a test model. Its fully privately financed 
Cosmos 1 spacecraft was designed and built together with the Russian 
Lavochkin Association and the Russian Space Research Institute . Looking
 a bit like a windmill, Cosmos 1 had eight triangular sails of15 meters 
(50 feet) in length. The spacecraft was launched with a Volna rocket - a
 converted ballistic missile left over from the old Soviet arsenal-<br>

from a submerged Russian submarine in the Barents Sea on June 21, 2005 .
 Unfortunately, the engine of the first stage failed less than 2 minutes
 into the flight and Cosmos 1 fell back to Earth. If it had made it into
 orbit, the solar sail would have been deployed by inflatable tubes. To 
prove the principle of solar sailing, the satellite would then have 
attempted to gradually raise its orbit by sunlight pressure alone. The 
Planetary Society had hoped that their demonstration would have opened 
the way to interplanetary space travel by solar sail, and would some day
 have led to a probe sailing to the stars. The inflatable tubes used on 
Cosmos 1 are also a novel space technology. Inflatable structures can be
 squeezed into small canisters and then inflated in space using tanks 
with compressed air, or gas generators that make gas through chemical 
reactions. Apart from use in long booms for solar sails, inflatables 
could be employed for huge dish-antenna space radiotelescopes and other 
large structures . The inflatable material can be configured so that it 
eventually hardens, for instance due to the ultraviolet radiation from 
the Sun. That ensures that the structure remains rigid even if it loses 
pressure owing to tiny punctures by micrometeorites. 264<br>
<br>
 A Bright Future Apart from the Cosmos 1 booms, there has been other 
experience with inflatable technology . In 1996, the Space Shuttle 
Endeavor successfully deployed a 14-meter (46-foot) prototype inflatable
 antenna in Earth orbit. In 2000 ESA and Russia launched their 
Inflatable Re-entry and Descent Technology (IRDT) demonstrator - a 
capsule with an inflatable re-entry heatshield. Initially it worked 
quite well, but unfortunately at lower altitudes a tear occurred in the 
inflatable shield, resulting in a higher velocity and a heavier than 
expected impact on landing. The IRDT capsule was damaged, but the 
valuable test data in its computer memory could still be retrieved. 
Hopefully, demonstrators such as Cosmos 1 and the ongoing development of
 solar sail and inflatable technology will make it possible to launch 
real, operational solar sailprobes sometime in the not too distant 
future. It is an elegant way of exploring space, reminiscent of the 
sailing ship expeditions of discovery in our past.<br>
<br>
NUCLEAR ENERGY Going out in the Solar System, beyond Mars, getting 
enough power is always a problem for probes equipped with solar arrays. 
That is why such spacecraft as Cassini and Galileo have RTGs that use 
the heat given offby slowly decaying radioactive metals to obtain 
electricity. However, a true nuclear reactor with a sizzling fission 
process would give much more power. Where spacecraft usually have to 
contend with a couple of thousand watts at most, a nuclear space reactor
 could supply tens to hundreds of kilowatts. Such large amounts of 
energy could, for instance, be used to employ powerful radars able to 
penetrate the thick ice shells ofJupiter's moons . Relatively small 
nuclear reactors have already been flown on board Earth-orbiting 
satellites. The USA has only launched one and that was in 1965; but in 
the 1960s and 1970s the Soviet Union powered many of its spy satellites 
with fission reactors. Until 1993, the Defense Department, the 
Department of Energy and NASA worked together on a 100-kilowatt reactor 
called SP-100. It was nearly fully developed and ground tests had even 
been conducted, but the SP-100 never flew. Recently NASA has proclaimed 
renewed interest in the technology for application in interplanetary 
spacecraft; the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter OIMO) project would have used a
 nuclear reactor. The fission process was 265<br>
<br>
 Chapter 9<br>
<br>
to provide energy for a series of ion thrusters to propel the 
spacecraft, and would generate unprecedented amounts of power for the 
rest of the onboard equipment. Powerful new types of scientific 
instruments, such as large radar and laser systems, could have been 
used. According to the plans, the spacecraft's power subsystem would 
give the craft over a hundred times more power than a traditional 
non-fission system of comparable weight. However, the project was going 
to be too expensive and, moreover, it appeared that the project was more
 driven by the (military) desire to develop a nuclear space reactor than
 to further explore the Jovian system. Not surprisingly, it was 
cancelled (although the development of a space reactor continues, 
because ofits uses for powering crewed lunar bases and interplanetary 
expeditions). There are many other, more modest and much cheaper ways to
 explore Jupiter and its moons than by using giant nuclear 
spacecruisers. Nevertheless, the use of nuclear reactors would make 
human missions to Mars a lot more feasible. Using them for propulsion 
would save a lot of propellant, and reactors could be used on Mars to 
provide energy for longduration stays.<br>
<br>
WORKING TOGETHER Another very interesting innovation is the idea of 
splitting the necessary functions over several spacecraft instead of one
 . ESA has, for instance, been studying a concept for a Jupiter mission 
called the Jovian Minisat Explorer OME). At present,JME is a feasibility
 study, set up to investigate the requirements and constraints that such
 a future mission may face. Nevertheless, it shows how, in the future , 
multiple spacecraft may work together. The JME mission concept involves 
two small spacecraft that, during launch and transfer to Jupiter, will 
be attached to each other. Once they reach their destination, they will 
split up. One will be put into a low orbit around the icy moon Europa, 
while the other will be flying high above Jupiter itself From an 
altitude of only 200 kilometers (125 miles), the Europa Orbiter will 
make detailed investigations of the moon and maybe even eject a compact 
microprobe to study the ice crust on the surface. At the same time, the 
other orbiter can begin its investigation ofJupiter. However, the Europa
 Orbiter will have to work very quickly, because<br>
<br>
266<br>
<br>
 A Bright Future<br>
<br>
Jupiter's strong magnetic field is full of charged particles. This 
results in intense radiation in a wide zone around the giant planet, and
 Europa orbits smack in the middle ofit. The damaging radiation will be a
 serious hazard for the spacecraft, especially to its sensitive 
electronics that will have to be particularly rugged and shielded by a 
thick layer of metal. Moreover, Jupiter's uneven and very strong 
gravitational field will continually try to push and pull the probe out 
ofits orbit. With the limited amount of propellant it can carry, the 
satellite will only be able to fight back for about two months. After 
that it will lack the thrust to compensate the perturbations and is 
doomed to crash onto Europa's icy surface. Because Europa is a place 
where life may possibly have evolved (under the surface ice), ESA will 
have to prevent contamination with microbes from Earth . This means that
 the spacecraft must be subjected to rigorous Planetary Protection 
sterilization measures, although the severe radiation around Jupiter may
 help to diminish the number of microbes on board. Before the crash, the
 Europa Orbiter will send all the data it has collected via high-data 
rate radio link to the other spacecraft, which will be in a much safer 
orbit. This Jupiter Relay Spacecraft will store all scientific treasure 
on its computer memory, and leisurely send it back to Earth . It can 
take its time doing that, using low data rates requiring limited 
transmitting power, because it will be in a much more stable, relatively
 low-radiation orbit.<br>
<br>
GOING FOR A WALK Mobile rovers greatly enhance the possibilities of a 
mission. Normally we don't exactly know what we are going to find at a 
new landing site (otherwise there wouldn't be much benefit from going 
there in the first place), or where exactly the lander will touch down. 
Nothing is more frustrating than to land in a scientifically exciting 
area, only to find that all the interesting rocks are just out of reach 
of the fixed spacecraft's robotic arm. With a mobile system, rather than
 having to land a spacecraft at exactly the right spot, it suffices to 
land somewhere in the vicinity ofan interesting area. The rover can then
 take the scientific instruments to the preferred location. Having a 
rover that is independent from its lander allows the engineers to 
separate the scientific and mobility functions from those only needed 
for descent and landing, which are left on the lander itself (and often 
the 267<br>
<br>
 Chapter 9 functions for flying through space stay behind as well, on a 
separate part of the spacecraft in orbit around the planet). Most 
current robotic planetary surface explorers, such as Lunokhods 1 and 2, 
the Pathfinder Sojourner rover and the recent MERs, have wheels. The 
only exception was the "hopper" lander on the Russian Phobos 2, which 
would jump over the low-gravity surface of the Phobos moon of Mars by 
rotating two sets of boom "legs." However, the Phobos 2 spacecraft was 
lost before this small lander could even be detached. Wheels allow a 
rather simple mobility and steering system, and you can achieve quite 
high speeds with them . However, wheels operate best on fairly level, 
smooth terrain - the kind you generally don 't find on any planet except
 Earth. Caterpillar tracks like those on tanks make it easier to move in
 uneven terrain, but they result in rather heavy vehicles that require a
 lot of power. Nature has never invented the wheel , probably due to the
 problem of connecting the skin, blood vessels, etc., of a body with 
rotating and therefore partly separated elements. Nevertheless, in rough
 terrain nature's solutions for land mobility are all far superior to 
wheels. Animals walk, hop, climb, slide and slither over, under and 
between rocks. They are able to cope with terrains in which our wheeled 
vehicles get stuck. Just try to get a machine with wheels to climb 
stairs! And a walking rover would have little trouble getting out of the
 soft, powdery sand dune that obstructed the Marsrover Opportunity for 
quite some time. It therefore makes sense for us to develop walking 
rovers that, for instance, can explore the Martian surface faster and 
more extensively. However, to make large robots walk on legs has proven 
to be very complicated. If you want your walking rover to always be in a
 stable position, you need at least four legs and cannot lift more than 
one at a time. That means a relatively slow vehicle. You can test this 
yourself: try to walk in such a way that you remain completely stable on
 one leg up to the moment that your other foot touches the ground. Only 
then do you move your weight and repeat the process with your other leg.
 Every step will take you much more time than usual. When you walk 
normally, you constantly shift your weight forward and are therefore 
continually out of balance. If you suddenly stopped during a normal 
step, you'd fall forward. While walking, you are what we call 
dynamically stable (i.e. you don't stumble), but statically unstable 
(i.e. you cannot suddenly "freeze" in a walking position without falling
 over). Small, multiple-legged animals like insects typically walk 
statically<br>
<br>
268<br>
<br>
 A Bright Future<br>
<br>
stable. At no point during their movements are they out of balance. 
Because they are very small and light they can still attain relatively 
high speeds in comparison to their size. However, somewhat larger and 
faster animals generally have no more than four legs and move statically
 unbalanced; they run dynamically stable. You would expect that this 
requires very complicated "software" and accurate measurements of 
terrain features, but even small-brained animals are very good at it. 
Somehow they (and we) are able to walk quickly without constantly 
observing and measuring the terrain on which they walk. The key appears 
to be a combination ofsensors that recognize "up" and "down" and 
indicate accelerations (the vestibular system in your head), as well as 
sensors in the legs that signal their position and when they touch the 
ground. Instead of depending on detailed maps indicating objects, 
heights and slope angles, animals rely on real-time reactions to 
impulses from their senses; they feel their way around, rather than 
calculate and plan. Walking robots are a hot topic in robotic 
development on Earth at the moment. Honda's ASIMO, for instance, is a 
human-like, human-sized robot that is able to walk on two legs. It can 
even climb stairs! ASIMO has been speciallydeveloped to operate in a 
human world with houses, doors, tables and light-switches. Furthermore, 
it can interact with humans; ASIMO can greet approaching people, move in
 directions they indicate, and even recognize their faces and address 
them by name. One day a descendent of ASIMO may accompany astronauts on 
their exploration of Mars, or even be the first to test whether humans 
can safely walk on a moon ofJupiter. An example of a simpler system is 
"Genghis," a six-legged, 1-kilogram (2-pound) walking robot developed at
 the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Each of its legs has two 
electro-motors that also give it some rough force measurement; if a leg 
hits anything, the increase in stress in the motors is sensed by the 
robot. That way Genghis can tell when a leg has touched the ground or 
hit an obstacle, so that it can keep its balance and is able to navigate
 over uneven terrain. Two whiskers in front prevent head-on collisions 
with obstacles in its path. The Scorpion robot of the University 
ofBremen in Germany has eight legs, with which it can move through sand,
 climb steep ramps, overcome obstacles and even walk along a beam, 
hanging upside down. In one experiment the Scorpion grabbed a plank with
 one leg, and walked away with it using the remaining seven legs. If 
moving relatively fast, walking robotic rovers would need to be much 
more autonomous than the current wheeled vehicles. If they had always to<br>
<br>
269<br>
<br>
 Chapter 9 wait for an operator on Earth to steer them around, their 
speed limit would be very low. Ideally, an operator should be able to 
just indicate where he or she wants the rover to go, and the robot 
should then be able to figure out how. A first application of this was 
tested with the Pathfinder rover, and was later also applied to its more
 sophisticated descendents Spirit and Opportunity. For these rovers, an 
operator chooses a suitable path on the images sent back by the robots. 
The operator then indicates a set of target locations along the route, 
and instructs the rovers to move from target to target, like golfers on a
 golf course. Additional commands , such as supplementary, in-between 
target locations or simple instructions to go a couple of centimeters 
back, only need to be sent when the rovers get blocked by unexpected 
obstacles. Even if the next generation of rovers still uses wheels, 
advanced onboard intelligence, as pioneered with the ASIMO robot, is 
still a very interesting technology to make rovers explore a planet's 
surface faster and more independently than they are doing now .<br>
<br>
FLYING Rather than driving or walking, some future robot explorers may 
be flying over Venus, Mars or Titan. Robotic planes can give us 
high-resolution, bird's-eye views of the terrain beneath . Moreover, 
they can investigate the atmosphere like no orbital spacecraft (too 
high) or surface rover (too low) ever could . In the 1990s NASA had 
plans for a small robotic plane to fly over Vallis Marineris, the famous
 "Grand Canyon" of Mars. It would have inflatable wings, a 
hydrazine-powered motor and be deployed from its clam-like descending 
capsule in mid-air. Because the density of the air on Mars is much lower
 than on Earth for a given altitude, the plane had to be designed with 
relatively large wings and an oversized-propeller. The vehicle was meant
 to reach Mars in 2003, to commemorate the first powered flight of an 
airplane by the Wright brothers a hundred years earlier. Unfortunately 
the project proved to be too complex and costly, and was cancelled. 
Nevertheless, the idea lives on. In 2002, an experimental Mars-plane 
called "Eagle" was successfully flown on Earth. To simulate the low 
density and pressure of the air on Mars, the plane was taken to an 
altitude of 30 kilometers (19 miles) by a stratospheric balloon. There 
it was<br>
<br>

<br>
FIGURE 9.4 ARES, a NA SA concept for a small plane that is to explore Mars from the air. [NASA]<br>
<br>
dropped , unfolded its wings and tail and subsequently made a 90 minute ,
 pre-programmed but unpowered flight back down. NASA hopes such tests 
will enable it to launch a real Mars-plane sometime after 2010. The 
atmosphere of Venus is much denser than that of Mars, making it easier 
for a plane to stay aloft. At an altitude of 64 kilometers (40 miles) 
above Venus, the air density is the same as on Earth at a height of 16 
kilometers (10 miles). A robotic plane could study the lower atmosphere 
of Venus from such an altitude, while staying above the high-temperature
 zones. Because of the Sun's proximity, a Venus plane could be powered 
by solar energy rather than a chemical engine. It would also benefit 
from the very slow rotation and therefore long day of Venus; staying 
around the same location, the solar cells on the wings could receive 
sunlight for 50 Earth-days without interruption. In comparison to a 
Mars-plane operating in a very thin atmosphere , it could also fly with 
less power. Balloons can provide another means of flying. They can be 
used to make measurements of the atmosphere ofVenus, for instance, just 
like the balloons of the RussianVega probes in 1985. Future balloons may
 use the temperature differences between the Mars day and night to make 
measurements of the planet's surface. During the day the Sun would heat 
up and thus expand the gas in the 271<br>
<br>
 Chapter 9 balloon. With a resulting lower density than the surrounding 
air, the system would float up. At night the balloon would cool down, 
shrink and slowly descend. A small experiment package hanging under the 
balloon would then touch the surface and make scientific measurements. 
The next day the balloon would automatically go up again and, driven by 
the wind, float to a new location. In this way a wide variety of 
locations could be investigated, while the precise tracking of the 
balloon would give us information about the wind strength and direction.
 Such balloons would be relatively simple and require little power, but 
would also be difficult to control and steer. Just as on Earth, 
zeppelins would be much more controllable. Aerodynamically shaped 
zeppelin-like aerobots with propellers could be used to actively 
navigate their way around. Covered with solar cells to power electric 
motors, they could also operate much longer than airplanes that require 
lots of power to stay aloft (however, these are smaller and fly faster) .
 Taking advantage of advances in micro-machinery and the relatively low 
gravity on Mars and Titan, one day we may even send insect-like flying 
robots to scout these worlds for us. Flapping wings give insects the 
ability to hover like a helicopter, softly touch down, quickly lift off 
straight up, and rapidly alter direction. With artificial muscles rather
 than conventional electric motors or engines, such robots could run on 
very little power.<br>
<br>
MICROBOTS Apart from the development oflow cost, perhaps even reusable 
launchers, it will also pay to design smaller and lighter spacecraft to 
bring mission costs down. "The lighter, the better" applies to nearly 
everything in spaceflight. The lower the mass ofa space probe the less 
expensive it is to launch , the more velocity it can gain from a rocket 
and the easier it is to land (smaller airbags, smaller parachutes, less 
propellant needed for retro-rockets, etc.). NASA's 1997 Sojourner 
Marsrover has already proven that with modem micro-electronics and 
miniaturized spacecraft equipment, even a small spacecraft can perform 
valuable science. Current designs for Russian microchods and NASA 
nanorovers are the size of a matchbox and have pushed the minimum 
volumes required for planetary rovers further down. The new field 
ofmicro-mechatronics will make it possible to shrink all kinds of space 
systems even more, and therefore drastically decrease the 272<br>
<br>
 A Bright Future<br>
<br>
FIGURE 9.5 Future robotic explorers may be very small, as shown by this NASA nanorover prototype. [NASA}<br>
<br>
total mass and volume of space probes. Acceleration-measuring devices of
 only one square centimeter and gearboxes that can only be seen with a 
microscope have already been built . Micromachines like these are 
extremely small, light, cheap and they use very little power. The use of
 such technology in spacecraft may have dramatic consequences: a lower 
spacecraft mass means that you need less propellant for attitude control
 and propulsion, therefore smaller tanks, resulting in a lower volume 
and lighter structure that also needs less thermal protection coverings.
 Snowball effects like these usually make the mass of a conceptual space
 probe spiral out of control by seemingly minor alterations in the 
design. However, the application of micromachinery may enable us to 
benefit from the high interdependability of spacecraft equipment; rather
 than spiraling outward, it may decrease spacecraft mass figures 
exponentially. The resulting microspacecraft could be the ultimate 
solution to the "Faster, Better, Cheaper" ideal. Such space probes could
 open a whole new world for space exploration. Instead ofbuilding one 
large, expensive spacecraft, it may be possible to build many more 
smaller craft for the same price. This would increase the chance of 
mission success, because 273<br>
<br>
 Chapter 9 the failure of one spacecraft would not mean the failure of the entire mISSIOn.<br>
<br>
For the future we may foresee swarms of small spacecraft investigating 
planets. Some may venture in highly dangerous areas, relaying data to 
motherships orbiting outside the danger zone. If we have a lot of them, 
some probes may be sacrificed on kamikaze missions to scout the way for 
other spacecraft. Like an army ofants, each of the probes in such a 
swarm could have its own task. Some may be measuring radiation, others 
may take pictures and again others may be only used for transmitting 
data between the probes and Earth . On planetary surfaces, some may have
 wheels to go far and fast, others may have legs to explore rough 
terrain or climb steep hills. They could even be combined: a wheeled 
rover that can move quickly to interesting sites, and deploy one or more
 legged robots for detailed investigations. A flying robot could be used
 to provide information on the precise locations of each individual 
explorer. Robots with the same hardware may still differ in their 
operational software, and could react differently to similar situations.
 While the programming of some probes may lead them into disaster, 
others will decide to do something different and survive. As with 
insects, the efforts or loss of an individual would be of little 
consequence, but together they may be able to do highly complex missions
 resulting in loads of new scientific data. NASA's Institute for 
Advanced Concepts is studying a system of using microbots for planetary 
exploration. It would involve the distribution of hundreds or even 
thousands of centimeter-scale robots over a planet's surface by an 
orbital mothership. The little probes would hop and bounce around, 
powered by polymer muscle actuators similar to those envisioned to power
 insect-like flying robot explorers. A suite of miniaturized imagers, 
spectrometers, sampling devices and chemical detection sensors would 
allow the microbots to investigate their surroundings. Collectively, the
 micro-explorers would be able to analyze a large portion of a planet's 
surface. However, significant advances would also have to be made in 
data processing and analyses techniques, otherwise it may be difficult 
to turn the enormous volumes of data collected by a legion of microbots 
into useful scientific information. Another interesting concept is to 
inject a large number of small probes into the atmosphere of a planet, 
to see where the winds at different locations would take them. This 
could lead to complex three-dimensional maps of wind patterns and 
atmospheric properties .<br>

 A Bright Future<br>
<br>
In the more distant future, even smaller nanomachines can be envisioned.
 Nanotechnology involves extremely tiny machines, no larger than a few 
nanometers, that are built up molecule by molecule. A nanometer is just a
 billionth of a meter; you'll need powerful microscopes to be able to 
see them. If we learn how to arrange atoms and molecules one by one, we 
could create very, very tiny machines with revolutionary abilities such 
as self-healing. The bodies of plants, animals and people have the 
amazing but crucial ability to repair themselves. If your body could not
 mend a small wound after you cut yourself, you would not survive very 
long . Machines on Earth generallycannot fix themselves, but we can do 
that for them. Not so, however, with space probes exploring the depths 
of the Solar System. As we cannot reach them , repair is impossible. 
When something fails, we can only switch to backup equipment, and if 
that also fails then the mission is over. Wouldn't it be great if we 
could give our spacecraft the ability to heal themselves? Nanotechnology
 may make it possible. Large, fatal cracks in a spacecraft's structure 
usually start as microcracks that slowly grow due to repeated bending or
 thermal expansion . One of the first steps in self-repair could be to 
embed glue-containing microcapsules into spacecraft materials. When 
microcracks formed in the structure, these would also break the capsules
 and release their healing glue. The cracks would be automatically fixed
 before they could grow longer and cause real damage. But real 
self-repair would require the equivalent ofcells in living beings; 
nanomachines acting like tiny factories that can produce sophisticated 
structures from raw materials available around them. They could be 
released at damaged places in the spacecraft and actively fix damage by 
repairing the material molecule by molecule . In biotechnology something
 like this already exists in the form of machines that can create 
specific sequences of amino acids on demand. Even more exotic (we are 
really getting into the science fiction area here) is the concept of the
 assembler/replicaror. These would be machines that are able to make 
copies of themselves, just as a living cell does. Each copy could then 
make a copy ofitself in tum, so the number ofassembler/ replicators 
would increase exponentially. We could then for instance "seed" an 
asteroid with some of these machines, after which they would start to 
replicate and "grow" large space structures such as antenna arrays for 
radio astronomy. Such possibilities appear rather far-fetched at this 
moment, but just like micro-electronics, nanotechnology may suddenly 
shift into top gear and cause a revolution on Earth as well as for space
 exploration.<br>

BEYOND THE SOLAR SYSTEM Pioneers 10 and 11, and the two Voyager 
spacecraft, are currently our most distant space probes. Voyager 1 has 
recently even reached the zone where the solar winds hits the 
interstellar gas, 14 billion kilometers (8.7 billion miles) from Earth .
 However, although these four probes sent us valuable data about the 
Solar System's far frontier, they have not been specifically designed to
 explore the area they are now flying through. Scientists would like to 
make detailed measurements of the heliopause, the blurry boundary 
between the Sun's immense magnetic bubble (called the heliosphere) and 
the interstellar gas. What kind of complex interactions are happening in
 this shock region, where the solar wind crashes into the interstellar 
medium? Furthermore, they are very interested in what lies beyond this 
boundary. What kind of particles, sent out by other stars, will we find 
there? Both NASA and ESA are doing studies on an Interstellar Probe, 
possibly using solar sails to reach the heliopause within a couple of 
decades. However, the spacecraft concepts are still in a very early 
stage. Over the past 10 years, astronomers have discovered over 150 
so-called exoplanets near other stars. Orbiting planets make a star 
"wobble," which can be measured by detecting the Doppler effect in the 
light of the star. Another way to find them is to accurately measure the
 amount of light from a star; if a large planet goes in front of it, the
 light will slightly dim. Most of the exoplanets discovered until now 
are very large and usually have a couple of times the mass ofJupiter. 
However, astronomers recently found a relatively small planet with a 
mass of 7.5 times that of the Earth and twice its radius around the star
 Gliese 876. The planet circles its mother star in a mere two days, and 
orbits so close to it that on its day side the temperature probably 
soars to around 200 to 400 degrees Celsius (400 to 750 degrees 
Fahrenheit) - much too hot for life as we know it. The planet thus also 
seems to orbit too close to Gliese 876 for liquid water to exist, but 
its atmosphere might contain a layer of dense steam. Its mass makes it 
probably too light to retain a very thick layer of gas around itself, so
 it perhaps more resembles the rocky planets like Earth and Mars, with 
an iron core and silicate mantle, than the giant gas planets such as 
Jupiter and Saturn. To date, it seems to be the most Earth-like planet 
ever found orbiting a star that is not much different from our Sun. 
Three other supposedly rocky planets have been discovered outside our 
Solar System, but they orbit a pulsar, the remains of an exploded star 
that is flashing at radio frequencies. 276<br>
<br>
 A Bright Future<br>
<br>
The discovery suggests that smaller, even more Earth-like planets 
probably exists too. However, due to their lower mass, Earth-size 
planets are hard to find with our current telescope technology. For the 
next decade, NASA and ESA are planning large space telescopes that 
should be able to find small planets orbiting other stars. Using 
spectroscopy, and based on what we have learned about the planets in our
 own Solar System, we may even be able to detect what kind of 
atmospheres these "exoplanets" have. Could there be planets out there 
with oxygen-rich atmospheres like Earth? What about sending a probe, a 
true interstellar explorer, to another planetary system? It can be done;
 even the two Pioneers and the Voyager twins are likely to reach the 
vicinity of other stars on some very distant day. However, to bridge the
 interstellar void within a human lifetime is extremely challenging. 
Let's return to the miniature Solar System introduced in Chapter 7. With
 a grapefruit acting as the Sun, Earth is a grain of sand orbiting 10.5 
meters (34 feet) away. Mars orbit would be at a distance of 16 meters 
(52 feet), and the outermost planet Pluto would circle at an average of 
414 meters (1,359 feet) from the Sun. The closest star, Proxima 
Centauri, would then need to be placed at a distance of about 2,900 
kilometers (1,800 miles). With the Sun being a grapefruit located in New
 York, our neighboring star would be found somewhere near Denver. 
Locating the Sun in Dublin would put Proxima Centauri near Moscow. The 
distance to Proxima Centauri is 4 light-years and 4 light-months; 
meaning it takes light 4 years and 4 months to get there. Voyager 1 is 
currently traveling at 17.5 kilometers (11 miles) per second, meaning 
that it could cover the 150-million-kilometer (93-million-mile) distance
 between the Earth and the Sun more than 3.5 times in a year. If we were
 to launch a probe straight at Proxima Centauri with an average speed 
similar to Voyager l 's current velocity, it would take about 750 
centuries to arrive! That is a bit long to wait for scientific return. 
There are ideas for extremely fast interstellar spaceships, all based on
 rather hypothetical means of propulsion that we will not be able to 
build for many years. A concept based on technology that might be 
available sometime this century is that of the Daedalus uncrewed 
interstellar space probe. Daedalus is the result ofa study performed 
between 1973 and 1978 by a small group of scientists and engineers 
belonging to the British Interplanetary Society. They started with the 
requirements that the spacecraft had to use current or near-future 
technology, that it would be 277<br>
<br>
 Chapter 9 able to reach its destination within 50 years, and that the 
design be flexible enough to be sent to any of a number of target stars.
 The selected baseline target was Barnard's Star, a red dwarf star 5.9 
light-years away. It was chosen over closer Proxima Centauri because 
astronomical data at the time suggested that Barnard's Star might be 
orbited by at least one planet (but this data was later found to be 
unreliable). To reach Barnard's Star in 50 years, the spacecraft would 
need to cruise at about 12 percent of the speed of light. Such a 
velocity cannot be achieved by conventional rockets, so the team had to 
look for a more advanced, and therefore not yet existing, means of 
propulsion. They chose to power the starship by nuclear fusion. Small 
pellets of deuterium and helium-3, 250 per second, would be injected 
into a huge combustion chamber and ignited by electron beams. A very 
powerful magnetic field would confine the nuclear explosions and channel
 the resulting high-speed plasma out of the rear of the spacecraft. In 
this way, the pulses of the thermonuclear explosions would provide an 
enormous thrust and enable Daedalus to reach the desired cruising speed 
within four years after launch. The whole vehicle would have a total 
mass of 54,000 metric tons (119 million pounds), including 50,000 metric
 tons (110 million pounds) of propellant and 500 metric tons (1,100 
thousand pounds) of scientific payload. With a mass almost 20 times that
 of a fully fueled Saturn V moonrocket, and being propelled by nuclear 
explosions, Daedalus could not be launched from Earth but would have to 
be constructed in space. Because the helium-3 required as propellant is 
very rare on Earth but not on the giant gas planets, Daedalus may even 
have to be built in orbit around Jupiter. The first stage of the 
two-stage ship would be fired for two years to take it to 7.1 percent of
 the speed of light, and then be jettisoned. Next, the second stage 
would start and continue to thrust for nearly another two years. 
Daedalus would then cruise, unpropelled and at a constant velocity of 12
 percent the speed of light, for another 46 years before reaching its 
destination. At such speed, a collision with even the smallest speck of 
interstellar dust could be a disaster. For protection, a 7-millimeter 
(0.3-inch) thick, 50-metric-ton (330,000-pound) disk of beryllium would 
be placed in front of the spaceship. However, that would not be enough 
shielding against even the impact of a l-gram grain of rock, which, at 
the cruising speed ofDaedalus, would hit with the energy of150 metric 
tons (330,000 pounds) of TNT explosives. 278<br>

Therefore an artificially generated cloud of particles some 200 
kilometers (120 miles) ahead of the vehicle would act as an additional 
shield. Any obstruction would be instantly vaporized by the super-fast 
impact with these particles. The resulting plasma would be stopped by 
the beryllium slab (the method is somewhat similar to that of Giotto's 
Whipple shield described on page 230). Decelerating the spacecraft would
 require as much propellant as needed for the departure (and the 
inclusion of this would mean that even more propellant would be needed 
to get up to speed in the beginning, due to the higher spacecraft 
starting mass). However, to limit the size and complexity of Daedalus, 
its design does not include provisions for deceleration upon arrival. 
Daedalus would thus fly by at an incredibly high speed and need to use 
optical and radio telescopes to investigate Barnard's Star and its 
hypothetical planets. Some years before arrival it would also launch 18 
autonomous probes for more detailed investigations. Powered by 
nuclearion drives, the probes would zoom past any planets and use their 
suite of instruments especially to look for signs of life and places 
that look hospitable for biology. If Daedalus represents one of the more
 feasible interstellar space probe designs, you can understand why no 
space agency is planning to build one very soon. The costs for its 
development and construction would be 279<br>
<br>
 Chapter 9 enormous and far too high for their current budgets. For the 
foreseeable future, the playground for robotic space explorers ends at 
the edge of the Solar System. And the fence is rather high.<br>

DR exploration and understanding of the Solar System has made giant 
steps since we first managed to launch space probes into the heavens. 
Fifty years ago, before the space age, we speculated that we would find 
soggy swamps on Venus and saw evidence that Mars was covered with 
vegetation. This invited science fiction writers to populate these 
planets' surfaces with kings and princesses defending mighty cities 
against hordes of indigenous monsters, and ancient but desperate 
civilizations digging vast canals to feed water to their dying planet. 
The robotic space explorers we sent to investigate put an end to these 
romantic visions. Instead oflush jungles with bathing dinosaurs on 
Venus, they found an overheated and overpressured hell that would be 
more inspiring to Dante than to famous science fiction writer Edgar Rice
 Burroughs. Instead of wise aliens living in glass dome cities on Mars, 
we found a desert planet full of rusty rocks harassed by dry dust 
storms. However, we found other and new things to inspire us, worlds we 
could not have imagined before the space age. We discovered moons with 
281<br>
<br>
 Chapter 10 subsurface oceans, methane rain and sulfur volcanoes. We saw
 brilliant auroras over the poles of giant gas planets and lightning on 
Jupiter. There are asteroids full ofprecious metals we may be able to 
mine some time in the future . We now know that Mars may once have had 
vast amounts of water running over its surface, and hope that life may 
still be surviving there somewhere . We developed a new view of Venus 
that gives us a strong warning about what can be the result ofus 
polluting our own world with greenhouse gasses. Without actually going 
out and visiting these alien worlds, we would never have collected more 
than a tiny fraction of our current knowledge about the planets and 
their history. When Voyager 1 flew by Saturn in 1980, a NASA JPL 
scientist commented "We have learned more about the Saturn system in the
 past week than in the entire span of recorded history." Even more 
important, space exploration has given us a new view on ourselves and 
our place in the Universe. Lunar astronauts showed us the Earth as a 
shiny blue marble in the infinity of space, a vulnerable small world 
that has been the set of the amazing evolution of life - life which, 
after billions of years, has finally developed the ability to reach 
other planets. Marslanders looked back and saw our planet as just 
another pale dot in the sky, unremarkable in appearance. If the Earth 
would suddenly disappear, the rest of the Universe would not notice. 
Nevertheless, that small world and its intelligent inhabitants have 
shown the potential to become a Solar System based civilization rather 
than one stuck on a single planet. The unique perspective of the living 
but fragile Earth rising over the dead, gray horizon of the Moon has 
become a symbol and inspiration for our environmental protection 
efforts. Space exploration has taught us that our own home planet isn't 
as infinite and everlasting as humanity subconsciously assumed until the
 twentieth century. Earth isjust another planet that happened to be in 
the right orbit around the right star at the right time. It's the only 
place we know for certain that can support millions of species of life 
(1.4 million known and between 10 to 100 million unknown species), and 
it is probably unique. We now know that we have to take care of our own 
home. Because of all the data gathered by the exploration of the planets
 and the detailed observations of the Earth, ignorance can no longer be 
used as an excuse for ruthless exploitation. Renewed perspectives such 
as these cannot be expressed in simplistic evaluations of costs and 
direct financial benefits to society, as some cynical and limited 
politicians and journalists tend to do. How do you measure<br>

the economic benefit of youth being inspired by space exploration to 
study science and engineering? Or the profit to a society that knows 
there is more in the Universe than traffic jams , taxes and brainless TV
 shows? How can we quantify to our descendants the advantages of this 
generation understanding our planet and its climate a bit better, and 
therefore leaving them a cleaner, healthier world? Space exploration has
 given humanity a context, an improved understanding of what and where 
we are. Six billion humans On a relatively small planet with a thin and 
fragile atmosphere, in the middle of an infinite and inhospitable vacuum
 . You would expect such knowledge to have a uniting and appeasing 
influence, but with all the wars that occur, the evidence for that is 
unfortunately rather poor. Even though the days of newspaper headings 
shouting "Man walks on Moon" or "Viking 1 lands On Mars!" are over and 
budgets for space science are more limited than ever, these are exciting
 times for interplanetary space exploration. During the two years it 
took to prepare this book, Mars Express and the rovers Spirit and 
Opportunity arrived at the red planet, and showed us Mars in a way we 
never saw it before. Then Cassini reached Saturn and deployed the highly
 successfulHuygens probe, which plunged deep into the Titan atmosphere 
and made it down all the way to the moon's bizarre surface. The 
ion-propelled SMART 1 went into orbit around the Moon, and is now 
uncovering new features about our old neighbor in space. Deep Impact was
 launched and half a year later shot a big hole into an asteroid, and 
the Japanese Hayabusa probe also reached its target asteroid. The return
 capsule of the Stardust mission landed back on Earth with a cargo of 
comet and stellar particles captured in space. We saw the launches ofthe
 comet explorer Rosetta, the Mercury orbiter Messenger, the large Mars 
Reconnaissance Orbiter, Venus Express and the New Horizons mission to 
Pluto . The Planetary Society's Cosmos 1 experimental solar sail was 
also launched, but unfortunately crashed due to a malfunctioning rocket 
engine. Furthermore, NASA announced that it will launch a new probe to 
Jupiter in 2010, named Juno. Then there was President Bush's 
announcement that the future of NASA's crewed spaceflight would be 
focusing on a return to the Moon and then missions to Mars. The earlier 
announced Aurora plan of the European Space Agency involves a similar 
vision, and is also inviting the Russians to be involved. At the same 
time, India and China are not only emerging as industrialized countries,
 but also as eager space-exploring nations. China launched its first 
astronaut in October 2003 and another two on board a single spacecraftin
 October 2005. Undoubtedly more will follow, as it has<br>

are named after the Italian-born French mathematician and astronomer 
Joseph Louis de Lagrange, who first derived their existence. laser 
altimeter: An instrument to measure altitude using a laser beam, whereby
 the time it takes the transmitted signal to bounce off a planet's 
surface and return to the instrument is a measure of the distance to it.
 launch window: The period of time during which a launch can take place,
 depending on the orbit and position of the target planet, the orbit of 
the Earth, the Earth's rotation and the trajectory needed for the probe 
to reach its destination . LEO: Low Earth Orbit - an orbit between about
 100 and 1,500 kilometers altitude . LGA: Low Gain Antenna - an antenna 
with which only relatively weak, but very wide beam radio signals can be
 transmitted and only relatively strong radio signals can be received. 
LGAs can only be used for low data rates.<br>
<br>
light-year: The distance traveled by light in one year. As light moves 
at 300,000 kilometers (186,000 miles) per second, a light-year is about 
9.46 trillion kilometers (5.88 trillion miles). magnetic field: A field 
in which magnetic forces are generated by electric currents . magnetic 
torquer: Long electromagnets that align themselves with respect to an 
external magnetic field when electricity is flowing through them. They 
are used in the attitude control of Earth-orbiting satellites. 
magnetometer: A sensor that measures the direction and sometimes the 
strength of a local magnetic field. 290<br>
<br>
 Glossary magnetosphere: The region in which a planet's magnetic field 
dominates that of the solar wind. It has a teardrop shape because on the
 day side the solar wind pushes on it, drawing out a long magneto tail 
on the night side. mass spectrometer: An instrument that can determine 
the type ofgas by measuring the mass ofits molecules. Normally used in 
combination with a chromatograph.<br>
<br>
MGA: Medium Gain Antenna - an antenna with which medium strong, medium 
narrow beam radio signals can be transmitted and medium weak radio 
signals can be received. MGAs enable the use of medium high data rates. 
momentum desaturation/unloading. The periodic slowing down ofa reaction 
(control momentum) wheel, to avoid it becoming uselessbecause it has 
reached its maximum velocity. Without any compensation, decelerating a 
wheel would make the spacecraft rotate, but by using opposite thrust 
from the reaction control system this can be avoided. Mossbauer effect: 
See "Mossbauer spectrometer." Mossbauer spectrometer: A spectrometer 
using a source of radioactive material to radiate samples with 
gamma-rays. The spectrometer then analyzes how the radiation gets 
absorbed by the sample to gain information about its composition (the 
absorption is called the "Mossbauer effect"). narrow-angle camera: A 
camera with a relatively narrow field of view, covering less surface 
area than a wide-angle camera but able to show more detail.<br>
<br>
NASA: National Aeronautics and Space Administration - the space agency 
of the United States. natural frequency: See "Eigenfrequency." Oort 
cloud: An immense spherical cloud of comets that surrounds the Solar 
System, enveloping the Solar System far beyond the orbit of Neptune. The
 Oort cloud extends to perhaps around 2 light-years, or 20 million times
 a million kilometers - half the distance to the next nearest star. The 
existence of the cloud was first hypothesized by Dutch astronomer Jan 
Hendrick Oort. organic molecules: Molecules contammg carbon atoms; all 
known forms of life are based on molecules with chains of carbon atoms, 
but organic molecules are not necessarily created by life. 291<br>
<br>
 Glossary<br>
<br>
oxidizer: The component of rocket propellant that releases oxygen for 
the combustion of the fuel. payload: The load carried by a launcher or 
spacecraft, i.e. the part that is the heart of the mission but not 
necessary for the basic operation of the vehicle or probe . For a 
launcher the payload is the spacecraftit carries, for a space probe it 
is the suite of scientific instruments. perihelion: The point in an 
elliptical, solar orbit where a spacecraft is closest to the Sun. 
periapsis: The point in an elliptical orbit where a spacecraft is the

contamination by possible microbes from space ("back contamination"), 
and to protect other bodies in the Solar System from contamination by 
microbes from Earth carried by visiting space probes ("forward 
contamination"). planetoids or planetesimals: Small, roughly spherical 
planets that are larger than the often irregularly-formed asteroids, but
 smaller than the main planets. plasma: A low-density gas in which some 
or all ofthe atoms or molecules are ionized (i.e. electrically charged).
 The total number of positive and negative charges is equal, therefore 
the plasma is overall electrically neutral. Prime Contractor: The main 
contractor responsible for a space project, reporting directly to the 
space agency that is financing and organizing the mission. radiator: 
Panels that absorb excess heat from inside the spacecraft and radiate it
 into space. radio altimeter: An instrument to measure altitude using a 
radio signal, whereby the time it takes the transmitted signal to bounce
 off a planet's surface and return to the instrument is a measure of the
 distance to it. radiometer: An instrument to detect and measure the 
intensity of thermal radiation, especially infrared radiation. reaction 
wheel: A fairly heavy, solid metal wheel with fixed axes that is used to
 rotate the spacecraft in different directions using the "action = 
reaction" principle. 292<br>
<br>
 Glossary<br>
<br>
redundancy: Having spare equipment built in that can take over from 
failing equipment units. resolution: The size ofthe smallest objects 
that can be still be individually distinguished by an instrument (also 
called "resolving power"). RHU: Radio-isotope Heater Unit, consisting of
 a few grams of radioactive material contained in protective cladding. A
 typical RHU emits about 1 watt of heat by the radioactive decay of the 
material inside. ring laser gyro: A type of gyroscope that uses the 
interference pattern between two parts of a split laser beam, caused by 
the Doppler effect, to measure how fast a spacecraft is rotating. RTG: 
Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator. RTGs work on the 
thermo-electric principle that a voltage can be generated between two 
different conducting materials if they are each kept at different 
temperatures. In an R TG the temperature difference is created by the 
heat emitted from the natural radioactive decay of plutonium.<br>
<br>
SADM: See "Solar Array Drive Mechanism." safe mode: The mode of 
operations to which a spacecraft automatically turns when something goes
 wrong. In safe mode, the robot puts itself into a stable situation to 
await orders from Earth. Sol: A Martian day, which lasts about 24 Earth 
hours and 37 minutes. solar array: A panel or set of panels covered with
 solar cells that generate electrical power from sunlight. Solar Array 
Drive Mechanism: A mechanism that keeps a spacecraft's solar array aimed
 at the Sun by rotating it around its axes. solar cells: Small, flat 
cells that convert sunlight into electrical power. Solar arrays on 
spacecraft typically consist of thousands of interconnected solar cells.
 solar wind: A tenuous, radial flow of gas and electrically-charged 
particles, mostly protons and electrons, streaming from the Sun's outer 
layer (called the corona). The expanding solar wind drags the solar 
magnetic field outward. The region of space in which this solar magnetic
 field is dominant is called the heliosphere. Solid State Recorder: A 
type of recorder that, unlike tape recorders and hard disk drives, has 
no moving parts. Instead it is based on several hundreds of memory chips
 for storing digital data. 293<br>
<br>
 Glossary<br>
<br>
sound barrier: The barrier that was long thought to limit aircraft to 
subsonic speeds. When an aircraft flies faster than sound, it has broken
 the sound barrier. spectrometer/spectroscope: An instrument used for 
splitting light or other forms ofelectromagnetic radiation into the 
component wavelengths, called a spectrum. If a camera or detector is 
used to record the spectrum, the device is known as a spectrograph. 
spectrograph: See "spectrometer/spectroscope." spectrum: A plot of the 
intensity of electromagnetic radiation at different wavelengths. In the 
case ofvisible light, the spectrum appears as a rainbow of colors (in 
fact, a rainbow is itself a spectrum of the Sun caused when its light is
 refracted by raindrops). spin stabilized: Spacecraft stabilization by 
rotation; as long as the probe is in balance, the gyroscopic effect 
keeps the rotational axis in the same direction. star mapper: An optical
 sensor that follows several stars in its field of view (as opposed to 
star trackers, which follow only one star). By remembering the positions
 of the stars with respect to each other, its electronics can determine 
the orientation of a spacecraft in all three dimensions . star tracker: 
An optical sensor that is pointed at a single star. By tracking how this
 star is moving in the sensor's field ofview, a star tracker can tell a 
spacecraft the direction in which it is moving or rotating. By keeping a
 star tracker trained at a certain star, the side of the space probe on 
which it is located is always pointed in the same direction. 
stereoscopic: Combining two pictures made from slightly different 
angles, a three-dimensional view can be created. Because people have two
 eyes observing objects at different angles, we have stereoscopic 
vision. subcontractor: A company working on a project under a contract 
with another company (a higher level contractor). subsystem: An assembly
 of equipment that work together to perform a particular task on board a
 spacecraft. Examples are the Thermal Control subsystem and the Power 
subsystem. sun sensor: A sensor that indicates the direction of the Sun 
(see also "coarse sun sensor" and "fine sun sensor").<br>
<br>

 Glossary<br>
<br>
three-axis stabilized: The spacecraft's attitude is actively controlled 
around all three possible rotational axes. trans-Neptunian objects: 
Objects orbiting beyond Neptune, including Pluto. ultraviolet: 
Ultraviolet (UV) light consists of electromagnetic radiation with 
wavelengths shorter than those ofvisible light, but longer than those of
 X-rays. UV wavelengths range from 100 to 350 nanometers, while Extreme 
Ultraviolet (EUV) ranges from 10 to 100 nanometers. Van Allen Belts: Two
 doughnut-shaped belts of high-energy charged particles that are trapped
 in the Earth 's magnetic field. They were discovered in 1958 by James 
Van Allen using measurements made by the Explorer 1 satellite. The inner
 Van Allen Belt lies about 9,400 kilometers above the equator, and 
contains protons and electrons from both the solar wind and the Earth's 
ionosphere. The outer belt is about three times further away and 
contains mainly electrons from the solar wind. wavelength: The 
wavelength of electromagnetic radiation is the distance between any two 
corresponding points on successive waves (for instance, from one peak to
 the next). Whipple shield: An impact shield consisting of two 
protective layers. The first vaporizes all but the largest of incoming 
particles, while the second absorbs any debris that pierced the front 
barrier. With two relatively thin layers, a Whipple shield can protect 
against particles that otherwise could only be stopped with a much 
thicker and heavier single layer shield. wide-angle camera: A camera 
with a relatively wide field of view, covering more surface area than 
narrow-angle cameras but not able to show as much detail. X-ray: 
Electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths shorter than those of 
ultraviolet rays and longer than those of gamma-rays. X-ray wavelengths 
range from one hundredth of a nanometer to 10 nanometers.<br>
