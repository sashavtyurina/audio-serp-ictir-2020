<p>On May 19, 2009, the Space Shuttle Atlantis released the <a href="http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/">Hubble Space Telescope</a>
 (HST) back into orbit after a hugely successful servicing mission, 
during which two new instruments have been installed on board the 
telescope, and two existing ones have been repaired. This marked the 
beginning of the next phase in the life of this incredible
observatory. During its 19 years of operation, HST has produced 39 
terabytes of data in the HST archive. At the time of this writing, 7,917
 refereed scientific articles have been written based on HST data. With 
such a record, it is clearly impossible to even just list the HST's 
scientific accomplishments in a short article. In what follows, I have 
attempted to briefly describe (in no particular
order) what I regard as the top five scientific discoveries. I should 
also note that rarely do astronomical discoveries belong to just one 
telescope. Usually it is many observatories, from the ground and from 
space, working in concert to produce a complete and multihued view of 
phenomena. Nevertheless, in the topics that I have selected, there is no
 doubt that HST played a crucial role.</p>
<h3>The Hubble Constant</h3>
<p>The astronomer <a href="http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Biographies/Hubble.html">Edwin Hubble</a>,
 after whom the Hubble Space Telescope is named, determined in the 1920s
 that our Universe is expanding. The fabric of space between any two 
distant galaxies is stretching, just like the rubber of an inflating 
balloon. The rate at which galaxies are currently moving apart from one 
another is
known as the <i>Hubble constant</i>, or <i>H<sub>0</sub>.</i> For a constant rate of expansion, the inverse of <i>H<sub>0</sub></i> gives the time at which the expansion started. But even in the presence of deceleration and acceleration <i>H<sub>0</sub></i> is the dominant factor in determining the age of the Universe.</p>
<p>Before HST, the value of <i>H<sub>0</sub></i> was known only to 
within a factor of two. The main reason for this large uncertainty was 
the fact that the determination of distances in astronomy is notoriously
 difficult. To overcome this obstacle, astronomers have constructed a <i>distance ladder</i> in which they use a series of <i>standard candles</i> — objects whose brightnesses are
relatively well known — to infer distances to objects that are increasingly farther away.</p>

<div class="leftimage" style="width: 400px;"><img src="5_files/Cepheid.jpg" alt="Cepheid variable star" width="400" height="343"><p>Figure 1: Cepheid variable star in galaxy M100. Image courtesy <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a>.</p>
</div>
<!-- END OF FILE: include/leftfig.html -->
<p>Key standard candles are certain pulsating stars — stars that show periodic variations in their brightness — known as <i>Cepheid variables</i>.
 These are luminous stars, about a thousand times more luminous than the
 Sun, whose intrinsic brightness is tightly correlated to their 
pulsation period. By measuring the period of the variation, astronomers 
deduce the intrinsic brightness, and by
comparing that to the apparent brightness, they can determine the 
distance (the apparent brightness decreases like the inverse square of 
the distance). The superb resolution of HST has allowed astronomers to 
isolate the light from numerous Cepheids in dozens of galaxies (figure 
1), and the uncertainty in the value of the Hubble constant has 
initially been reduced to about 10%. Most recently,
detailed HST observations of Cepheids in the galaxy NGC 4258 — whose 
distance is very accurately known through radio observations — coupled 
with observations of well-calibrated supernova explosions in more 
distant galaxies, have reduced the error in the value of <i>H<sub>0</sub></i> to less than 5%.</p>
<h3>Dark Energy</h3>
<p>In 1998, two teams of astronomers working independently discovered 
that the expansion of our Universe is in fact speeding up, propelled by 
the repulsive force of a mysterious <i>dark energy</i>. This came as a 
shock, because the prevailing assumption was that cosmic expansion 
should be slowing down due to the mutual gravitational attraction of all
 matter within the Universe. The precise nature
of the dark energy that powers the acceleration is arguably the biggest 
puzzle that physics is facing today. Since the discovery, observations 
of the cosmic microwave background radiation have shown that dark energy
 makes up more than 70% of the total energy density of the Universe. The
 Hubble observations relied on a particular type of supernova explosion 
(known as Type Ia supernovae) to trace
the expansion history of the Universe (figure 2), and thereby to place 
constraints on the properties of dark energy. There are two factors that
 make type Ia supernovae particularly useful in this regard. First, they
 are extremely bright, and therefore can be observed half way across 
cosmic time. Second, they are good standard candles — their luminosities
 are nearly constant — and therefore their
distances can be determined quite accurately. Hubble's sharp vision has 
allowed astronomers to pinpoint distant supernovae in galaxies that are 
as far as nine billion light-years away, and to determine that dark 
energy was already present (though not dominant) even at that early 
stage, when gravity still had the upper hand and the expansion of the 
cosmos was decelerating.</p>

</div>
<!-- END OF FILE: include/centrefig.html -->
<p>All the observations to date are consistent with dark energy being the <i>energy of empty space</i>.
 Quantum mechanics, the theory that most accurately describes the 
sub-atomic world, says that the physical vacuum, far from being empty, 
is teeming with virtual particles that appear and disappear in split 
seconds. The energy density associated with the vacuum is constant, and 
characterised by
an <i>equation of state</i> parameter <i>w</i> (the ratio of pressure to density), which, according to the theory, satisfies <i>w = -1</i>. Most of the current observational efforts are directed at determining whether <i>w</i> is indeed constant across cosmic time, and whether its value is equal to <i>–1</i>.
 However, even if the characteristics of dark energy will be found to be
 fully consistent
with it being the energy of the vacuum, many open questions will remain.
 In particular, naive attempts to theoretically calculate the expected 
value of the vacuum energy density produce results that are more than 50
 orders of magnitude higher than the observed value (see <i>Plus</i> article <a href="https://plus.maths.org/content/os/issue51/features/lambda/index">Lambda marks the spot</a>
 for more information).
Consequently, a true understanding of dark energy will require a 
combination of observational efforts coupled with significant 
theoretical developments.</p>
<h3>Galaxy formation and evolution</h3>

<div class="rightimage" style="width: 300px;"><img src="5_files/whirlpool.jpg" alt="The whirlpool galaxy" width="300" height="375"><p>Figure 3: The heart of the Whirlpool Galaxy. Image courtesy <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a>.</p>
</div>
<!-- END OF FILE: include/rightfig.html -->
<p>Everyone is familiar with the shapes of the galaxies that we see in 
the relatively local Universe. Galaxies such as the Milky Way and the 
Andromeda galaxy are disc galaxies: they are flattened like pancakes, 
and are characterised by a prominent spiral structure traced by young 
stars (figure 3). Other galaxies are elliptical: they are shaped like 
oval concentrations of relatively old stars. One
of the key goals of astronomy is to understand how galaxies form and how
 they evolve. Astronomers using HST produced the deepest images of the 
Universe in optical light. These observations were dubbed the <i>Hubble Deep Fields</i> and the <i>Hubble Ultra Deep Field</i>
 (figure 4). The observations revealed that galaxies in the distant past
 were smaller in physical size, and that their shapes were
much more irregular. These two properties are consistent with a scenario
 of hierarchical structure formation, in which smaller building blocks 
of galaxies collided and coalesced frequently in the early, dense 
Universe, to form the larger galaxies we observe today. Using HST's 
exquisite spatial resolution and photometric stability, astronomers were
 also able to observe in detail the stellar
populations in the old halos of nearby galaxies, which allowed them to 
reconstruct how mass was assembled in these galaxies.</p>

</div>
<!-- END OF FILE: include/leftfig.html -->
<p>Finally, the deep-field observations yielded the history of the 
global rate of star formation in the cosmos. Even before the Hubble 
observations, astronomers knew that our Universe as a whole is past its 
peak in terms of the rate of birth of new stars. The peak occurred about
 7 to 8 billion years ago. The Hubble Ultra Deep Field showed that when 
the Universe was less than one billion years old
(the Universe today is 13.7 billion years old) the rate of cosmic star 
formation was lower than the peak value by about a factor of three, but 
already higher than the rate today, which is about a factor of ten lower
 than at the peak. In other words, once the Universe started forming 
stars, it did so furiously.</p>
<br clear="all"><h3>Supermassive black holes</h3>
<!-- FILE: include/rightfig.html -->
<div class="rightimage" style="width: 400px;"><img src="5_files/blackhole.jpg" alt="The whirlpool galaxy" width="400" height="309"><p>Figure 5: Hubble confirms the existence of a massive black hole at the heart of an active galaxy. Image courtesy <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a>.</p>
</div>
<!-- END OF FILE: include/rightfig.html -->
<p>Astrophysicists have long suspected that active galactic nuclei — the
 extremely bright cores of galaxies that show violent activity — and 
quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) create their extraordinarily high 
luminosities by accreting mass at a high rate onto a black hole that 
lies at their centre. The power emitted simply reflects the rate of 
release of gravitational potential energy. However, before
HST it was virtually impossible to detect the host galaxies of QSOs, and
 it was extremely difficult to confirm the presence of a black hole, 
except in a couple of relatively nearby galaxies, and in our own Milky 
Way Galaxy. HST changed all that. First, it has unambiguously detected 
the host galaxies in a few relatively nearby QSOs. Second, by following 
the motions of individual stars (or of gas
discs) around the centres of tens of galaxies, it has shown that 
essentially all the galaxies that have a central bulge of stars harbor a
 supermassive black hole at their centres (figure 5). The masses of 
these black holes range from a few millions to a few billions of solar 
masses. But in addition to the mere discovery of the black holes, HST 
provided two other significant pieces of information.
First, high-resolution images of the hosts of QSOs revealed that many of
 them were interacting galaxies and the others were bright elliptical 
galaxies. This suggests that certain environments (such as the one 
resulting from an interaction) may be needed to funnel gas into the 
central regions to fuel the black holes.</p>
<p>Second and more important, the masses of the black holes were found 
to be tightly correlated with the masses of the smooth, spherical bulges
 of stars surrounding the galactic centres. This indicates that the 
black holes and their host galaxies do not evolve independently, but 
rather that their evolutions are intimately connected — massive black 
holes are apparently a generic feature of galaxy
formation and evolution.</p>
<h3>Extrasolar planets</h3>
<!-- FILE: include/leftfig.html -->
<div class="leftimage" style="width: 481px;"><img src="5_files/planet.jpg" alt="The whirlpool galaxy" width="481" height="365"><p>Figure 6: A planet's telltale signature. Image courtesy <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a>.</p>
</div>
<!-- END OF FILE: include/leftfig.html -->
<p>Until 1992, we did not know of a single planet outside our solar system. In 1992, the first so-called <i>extrasolar planets</i>
 were detected, but they did not orbit an ordinary star such as the Sun.
 Rather, they were found around a pulsar — an extremely compact object 
with a mass of about 1.4 solar masses, but a radius of only about 10km. 
The first planet around a Sun-like star was discovered
in 1995. Since then, astronomers have discovered about 350 extrasolar 
planets. Most of these planets were discovered by ground-based 
telescopes. Still, HST has contributed a few unique observations to this
 field. First, Hubble focused on transiting planets — planets whose 
orbital planes are aligned with our line of sight, so that the planets 
periodically eclipse their host stars. When the planet
passes in front of the star, it blocks some of the star's light. From 
the amount of dimming (typically 1-2%) the radius of the planet can be 
deduced (figure 6). But this is not all. Some of the starlight passes 
through the planet's atmosphere, where part of it is absorbed by various
 atoms. By concentrating on particular spectral lines, the presence and 
abundance of certain atoms and molecules can
be determined (see <i>Plus</i> article <a href="https://plus.maths.org/content/os/issue51/features/dartnell/index">Hunting for life in alien worlds</a>
 for more on this technique). In this way, HST observations showed that 
the atmosphere of the planet around the star HD 209458 contains sodium, 
carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. In another case, even water and methane 
were detected. These were the first determinations of the composition 
of
atmospheres of extrasolar planets.</p>

<!-- END OF FILE: include/rightfig.html -->
<p>Most of the extrasolar planets were found around stars in the solar 
neighborhood. This still left open the question of whether the local 
fraction of stars hosting planets is typical of the Galaxy at large. To 
answer this question, HST observed about 180,000 stars in the crowded 
central bulge of our Galaxy, half-way across the Milky Way. These 
observations led to the discovery of 16 planet
candidates, a tally consistent with the frequency of planets in the 
solar neighborhood, and they showed that the Galaxy is indeed teeming 
with billions of planets. Five of the planet candidates were found to 
whirl around their stars in less than one Earth day, and they were 
dubbed <i>Ultra-Short-Period Planets</i>.</p>
<p>Finally, HST produced the first visible-light snapshot of a planet orbiting another star. The planet, known as <i>Fomalhaut b</i> since it circles the bright southern star Fomalhaut, was resolved inside a large debris disc, somewhat similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt">Kuiper Belt</a> in our own solar system. The planet's distance from its host star is about ten
times the distance of the planet Saturn from the Sun.</p>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>Following Servicing Mission 4, Hubble has the largest complement of 
functioning instruments it has ever had. Assuming that the Wide Field 
Camera 3 (WFC3), the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS), the Advanced 
Camera for Surveys (ACS), and the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph 
(STIS) will work as expected, many Hubble discoveries are still to come.
 In particular, WFC3, with its infrared
capabilities, will take us even closer to the very first galaxies, and 
COS will reveal to us the structure and composition of the <i>cosmic web</i>
 — the filamentary intergalactic gas. You can be almost certain that 
five years from now, the list of the top five Hubble discoveries will 
have to be revisited.</p>
